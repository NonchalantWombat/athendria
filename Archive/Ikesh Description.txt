Located in the southern hemisphere of Athendria, Ikesh contains multitudes of peoples and beasts, magic and mystery, history and conflict. Its lush forests, barren plains, jagged mountains and rolling hills are filled with civilizations, some new, some old, and several long dead. In the year 1127 P.C., there have been several decades of relative peace and prosperity. After the events of the repelled Aboleth Invasion from Yoria in 1094, the waves of psychic energy which washed across Athendria in the death throes of the Blood Queen have created lingered effects. Occasionally, children are born with the innate power of telepathy, or others manifest slight telekinesis. The strangeness of these abnormalities has rapidly faded into normalcy, and most view these developments as quirky, but of little significance.

In Ikesh, there are many opposing forces, balanced well (for now) by power and mutually assured destruction. The largest and oldest of the powers, the drow empire known as the Reznor Dominion, resides in the gloomy, rainy southwest, and dominates major connecting trade route paths through the Darkspire Mountains. Led by the ageless Shadequeen Lyvrenna Daevyth, the Reznor have been quietly gaterhing their strength after a violent history of expansion and conflict with their neighbors.

One such neighbor is the island-continent nation of Autria. On it, the warforged denizens and their friends prefer to focus on technological innovation and exploitation of rare resources in the expansive Rust Barrens. Their history of armed conflict with the Reznor over such resources culminated in the Spark Wars and rapid development of airship technology, some 50 or so years ago. The war resulted in a stalemate, and the two nations have been in an uneasy truce ever since, avoiding confrontation.
