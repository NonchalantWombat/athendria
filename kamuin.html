<li>
    <h2 id="section-brightshore"> Brightshore (The Glittering City)</h2>
    <img src='https://i.postimg.cc/HxC5HS7s/Brightshore.png' alt='Brightshore' style='width:900px;'>
    <p> West of Lutetia, this trading hub is the continent’s main point for intercontinental trade across the Vanjan Sea. It is so named because of its glittering rivers, flow of wealth, and erous lighthouses. Most of the region’s goods flow through this port, or come up from Modouli. Second only to Lutetia in prosperity, the various islands of Brightshore are separated by the Frostfall river as it turns into a delta and meets the ocean. There are beautiful villas in the wealthy district, home to many of the trade barons who oversee sea and river trade routes. The southern regions are a picture of abject poverty, as many of the poor sailors and their families struggle to get by. The small island Ladentree sports a discount inn called the Happy Hag. The docks are always bustling, any time of day, as trade deals and passage to distant lands are a must.</p>
    <h3>Important Denizens:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Baron Daedrin Maximilian: A pale skinned, human male overseer of Fort Lucerno, who maintains a stranglehold on the transition of trade into and out of the region. His connections to the Maximilian family in Lutetia grant him access to immense wealth and influence.</li>
            <li>Captain Ergant Brannis: A battle-scarred male green dragonborn, the gatekeeper of the Glittering Gate, and captain of the Brilliant Bastion, Brightshore's law enforcement.</li>
            <li>High-Bearer Hutrumi Mudback: A dwarven high priest of Kord, and keeper of Kord’s Respite. He is knowledgeable about the sea and weather, and wise in the ways of storms and sea faring.</li>
            <li>Mardealda Browntoe: Jovial dwarven innkeeper of the Happy Hag on Ladentree Isle.</li>
            <li>Dockmaster Erik: Red-haired, middle-aged human overseer of the docks in Brightshore. </li>
            <li>Captain Baird Dullblade: Male Half-Orc Captain of the Castor, headed to Skulldura to supply his village with essential supplies for the winters. </li>
            <li>Captain Avery 'Silver Tooth' Bentley: Female Dwarvish Captain of the Dapper Otter, heading to Grozmirlun to return with his wealth of midland resources </li>
            <li>Captain Kenley 'Fishy' Colby: Male Tortle Captain of the Dogstar, heading to Crystallia on a regular trade route </li>
            <li>Captain Cable ‘Defiance' Reyson: Male Elvish Captain of the Airship Starling, heading to Uthorim and seeking new energy sources for ships to engage in the wealthy trade with Crystallia</li>
        </ul>
</li>
<li>
    <h2 id="section-lutetia">Lutetia</h2>
    <img src='https://i.postimg.cc/W493YX6H/Lutetia.png' alt='Lutetia' style='width:600px;'><br>
    <img src='https://i.postimg.cc/cHwwC9CB/Lutetia-Dec-2020.jpg' alt='Map Lutetia' style='width:900px;'>
    <p>This bustling metropolis forms the beating heart of the empire. A tremendously prosperous city, wealthy and poor alike from across the continent call it their home. Located along the Frostfall river on its way out towards the Vanjan Sea, almost all travel and trade across the western side of Kamuin travels by this city. The deterring presence of the Crimson Cloaks, as well as other powerful factions, wards off orc bands and wild animals. Lutetia has a highly prolific criminal underbelly, which is in constant conflict with the law. Religious worship of all gods and deities can be found here, with temples to each scattered across the city. The government of the empire is based out of this city, with leadership formed primarily by representatives from the wealthy trading families and the Emperor himself.</p>
    <h3>Notable Locales:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Sewers: Many homeless and questionable denizens lurk here. It is rumored to be a focal point for the Nightwalker Theive's Guild, and those who go looking for them tend to disappear.</li>
        <li>Clearwater Academy: This institute of higher learning is generally available only to nobles or those with the necessary talents. The academy's professors are generally more altruistic than many of the more talented magic users in the city, and less specialized.</li>
        <li>The Silver Table: A cheap and dingy inn near the western city gate, ran by a crotchety old man named Theo.</li>
        <li>Fevagore Castle: The seat of power in the Empire, and the previous home to the Emperor. All the important political families meet here as part of the Council of Eight and discuss matters of importance regarding governance.</li>
        <li>The Saintly Sheep: A famous brothel run by the infamous Madame Janeta. Among the "usual" offerings, it also provides excellent beds, natural hot spring baths, and exquisite food.</li>
        <li>The Magician's Respite: A secluded gated community comprised solely of wealthy and reclusive magic users, too snooty or paranoid to contribute to the knowledge of Clearwater Academy.</li>
        <li>Temples to the Gods: Across Lutetia are many temples, all dedicated to various dieties approved within the city. The larger the ber of worshippers, the larger the temple.</li>
        <li>Squalortown: Outside the city walls, the general wealth and prosperity gives way to a shantytown of the poor and misfortunate living on the fringes of the city.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important Denizens</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Gowron the Eruditious: A slim orc with pale skin and unusual intelligence with a degree in orc studies from Clearwater Academy in Lutetia. Gowron was cast out of his tribe at an early age, since the clan warchief considered him an eventual threat, and was adopted by a friendly gnome wizard on the fringes of the forests outside the Balmere Plateau. He eventually moved to Lutetia and pursued a career in magicks to promote orcish welfare and reduce prejudice around his race. He dabbles as a wizard and inventor, currently attempting to utilize stray cats and their extra lives as a source of energy. He has recently devoted himself to his research and moved to private facilities outside Squalortown, as he recently acquired a grant from unknown sources to produce energy ingots.</li>

Situated at the literal intersection are three statues: an elf pointing towards Modouli (Semet the Vigorous, a desert elf who helped found Modouli several hundred years ago), a gnome (Fizbin the Wise, who drove out Sauhuagin and made Brightshore 200 years ago), and a human male with a club (Charles the Hearty, a barbaric but wise defender of justice who helped drive out wandering orc bands in the Balmere Plateau, allowing Lutetia to thrive and trade to flourish.)</p>
    <h3>Important Denizens and Shops</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Nickleback Schnicklefritz: A wandering homeless halfling, this strange fellow with bulging bloodshot eyes and a limp has a random assortment of dubious goods at very cheap prices. Finding him is a bit of a search, and needs a high investigation roll to figure out what corner of the region he's holed up in.</li>
        <li>Books and Bobbles: (owned by Cygna the Curious (an aged gnome with neon green hair and thick glasses)) is one of the three permanent installments. It is an ancient and random collection of knowledge from across the continent.</li>
        <li>The Raggedy Wizard: (owned by Kalondra the Broad (muscled female dwarf with glorious beard and braids)) is a constantly overflowing inn with inflated prices, with only the truly weary paying the fees for stay.</li>
        <li>Rango Ranch: (owned by Hugo Higgins (halfling male with a shock of dyed blue hair)) maintains a wide variety of oxen, horses, and some various exotic mounts to facilitate travelers and their travel across the western reaches of the continent.</li>

    <img src='https://i.postimg.cc/g2rVD7CD/Skulldura2.jpg' alt='Skulldura' style='width:900px;'>
    <p>This frozen, icy fishing village lies to the farthest northern reach of Kamuin. Iceburgs form a thorny perimeter off the coast, and many small sailing vessels wander offshore, catching and hunting the famous Droppkulur. These strange beasts resemble massive, shaggy walrus, with the difference of having a single great horn protruding from its face like a rhino. Many Skulldurian youths attempt to slay and bring back a Droppkulur as proof of their skill and tenacity. The denizens are all nordic humans, but a select few occasionally manifest slightly aquatic features, such as small fins, scales, or patches of bluish skin. Those that do are considered blessed by the sea, and call back to the ancient founders of their village, who they refer to as the Anointed.</p>
    <h3>Important Denizens:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Waverider Bjorne: As the village chieftain, Bjorne has been struggling of late with strange cultists in the wastes nearby, several of whom originated from the village. They worship a strange entity, a personification of the planet Yoria in the night sky. He wants to bring the village youths back and save them, but they have desecrated the sacred sanctum in the ice caverns and stole an ancient artifact.</li>
        <li>Móðir Annvieg: The spiritual leader and elderly matron of the village, with fish-like fins protruding where ears would be. She is wise and has a strong connection with the ocean. She worships an entity called the Deepwalker, and is the keeper of the ice caverns and the shrine below the waves. She was injured when the cultists broke in and stole an artifact, and bears great resentment towards them for that.</li>
        <li>Hranfast Hognisson: A well-meaning fisherman who frequently hunts Droppkulur.</li>
        <li>Bolla Sigehelmdottir: A woman of the village, she helps raise the children and frequently aids Annveig with her work.</li>
        <li>Arnthor Gunnkelsson: A youth who led the raid to steal the village artifact, and who hasn't been seen in months, after he left to join the Cult of Yoria.</li>
        <li>Hrollaug Gunnkelsson: The brother to Arnthor, who worries for his safety and sanity. He witnessed his brother's descent into madness, and worries about what caused his to do so.</li>

    <img src='https://i.postimg.cc/NMDhBjjJ/Ruins-of-Thaumdural.webp' alt='Ruins of Thaumdural' style='width:600px;'>
    <p>Located on the tallest peak of the Worldspire Mountain range, accessible only via the Frostfall river into the mountains and a treacherous journey up the mountainside, this ancient ruined city is built into the remains of a gigantic crater at the top of Mount Strohlcairn. It is theorized the crater was formed eons ago during a volcanic eruption, long before the dragonborn decided to settle in and make it their home. The temperature is warm and steamy, thanks to erous geothermal springs heated by underground lava flows. Years ago, the city's wealth stemmed from breeding and trading exotic flying mounts (griffons and hippogriffs) with the Empire and other city states, as well as from modest mining operations in the caves below. it was a prosperous city before disaster struck. A portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire opened decades ago, and an ancient red dragon known as Hemdorak tore his way through. He drove the dragonborn from their homeland, killing nearly half their bers in the process. The dragon was eventually defeated by the heroic Capable Crew, but the city was destroyed in the process. The mountain is now a desolate wasteland, covered in lavaflows and steam, with a burning active portal at the peak. This open portal is a target for the denizens of the Plane of Fire, as it opens relatively close to the City of Brass on the other plane, and could provide access to Athendria for entrepreneurial creatures from other planes. A host of devils have created a base atop the mountain, and are mining its depths for valuable gemstones and other resources. Leading this effort, is the devilish deal-maker, Demiurge, the Herald of Zagum. His lieutenant, Rain, is a shifter paladin.</p>

    <img src='https://i.postimg.cc/PxWy9rWH/Swarthmore.jpg' alt='Map of Swarthmore' style='width:900px;'>
    <p>Several days travel by river north of Frostford, this small hunting and farming village sits on the edge of the Crast Hills, at the base of the Worldspine Mountains. The local population is primarily human and half-orc, as wandering orcish tribes roam the hills and frequently clash with this outpost. Rugged, and lacking in most comforts, Swarthmore has stood stubbornly for generations as a testament to the hardiness of the northerner peoples. The denizens are untrusting of outsiders. They are led by Duke Arroway, and seek advice from mystic of Gruumsh. Local small natural gold deposits provide some of the more enterprising residents a source of income to trade for food with travelers. The village frequently fends off raids from Orc bands and wild beasts, and it is an important outpost at the corner of the empire for maintaining positive relations on the border.</p>
    <h3>Important Denizens:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Duke Mord Arroway: The tall, gentle half-orc leader of Swarthmore. A rugged and no-nonsense leader who reports to the Emperor and monitors movements of the orc tribes in the north near Urk. He governs Swarthmore as a respected official, the last bastion of civilization before Thaumdural at the base of the Worldspine Mountains. He is known for his tremendous strength and tenacity in guiding his people through the harsh winters of the north.</li>
        <li>The Mystic: A hooded and robed elder who resides in the lodge at the top of the cliffside. They predict the weather, provide insight and guidance on daily work, and magically protect Swarthmore from invaders when necessary.</li>
        <li>Ovir Hesh: An older human woman who runs the water-mill. She is an essential asset to her community by processing grain they farm and turning it into edible foodstuffs and tradable goods. She also dabbles in alchemy in her spare time. She sells some ingredients unique to the Crast Hills.</li>
        <li>Tuko Derm: A half-orc middle-aged man who operates a general store in the center of Swarthmore. He trades flour and gold for food and furs.</li>

    <img src='https://i.postimg.cc/t4mx51Mf/Lubdin.jpg' alt='Map of Lubdin' style='width:900px;'>
    <p>A few days journey southwest of Oakdale, this small village bordering the massive swamp of Cuvel’s Slough is a testament to the stubbornness (and xenophobia) of its inhabitants. The Lubdinites have lived in these woods for generations, eking out a meager existence far removed from any of the political or religious turmoil of the rest of the continent. An Elder Ooblex, one of the horrors that Birru had sealed away, had appeared in the Slough and had created an artificial village filled with fascimilies of the many creatures and people it had absorbed over the millenia. The Capable Crew slew the monster and returned the local region to peace. The Slough is still a mysterious place, and not many who enter it return.</p>
    <h3>Important Denizens:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Firden and Ren Hannod: The owners of the Ale King Tavern, a gossiping and judgmental pair. They embody the intolerance of the town.</li>
        <li>Ruby: The mother of Spinel. This kindly and hard-working human woman living on the outskirts of town has made her living off the land for decades. She is tight-lipped about Spinel's father, and is fond of wandering the edge of the swamp in her spare time.</li>
        <li>Crayg: The recently arrival to town, Crayg is a Dao from the Plane of Earth. He is Ruby's long-lost love and Spinel's father, and he and Ruby have been spending plenty of time alone.</li>

    <h2 id="section-modouli">Modouli</h2>
    <img src='https://i.postimg.cc/jjjKvYv5/Mouduli.jpg' alt='Map Modouli' style='width:900px;'>
    <p>A distinct city-state deep in the desert and near the coast, this ancient city is home to diverse inhabitants from many lands. It trades with Lutetia, Brightshore, and other continents frequently, but exists independent of any exterior rule. Modouli contains the only fresh water source for over a hundred miles, and is the source of the city’s prosperity. The city is surrounded by boundless deserts and mesas, with only the ocean to break the monotony.</p>
    <h3>Important Denizens:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dire Ranid: A large, muscular man with two identities: this eccentric character exists as two people, a calm and collected sorcerer, and a raging idiot barbarian. He switches between personalities with no warning or reason. The only indication of which he is depends on whether or not he is wearing glasses.</li>
            <li>Grand Baroness Kaleerah Bekshan: The local ruler of Modouli, she resides in her Starview Palace and leads raids into the desert on the back of her domesticated Purple Worm. She is a half-elvish Champion of the desert wastelands. She is well known for fighting off the advances of the Lamia (desert monsters) with the help of various desert tribes, and is always looking for ways to increase safety for her people. Not technically part of the Empire, Modouli operates under her rule freely, trading with other prominent coastal cities.</li>
            <li>Redjaw the Rich: A ginger-haired half-ogre who runs the food cart Flavor Gypsies. He is sells kebabs around the city, but is also a ruthless, cunning, and brutal crime boss. He has some human ancestry, which accounts for his ginger hair and abnormal intelligence for an Ogre. He has tanned skin, copious/excessive gold and silver jewelry, and gaudy baggy clothes to cope with the heat. His golden scimitar is a symbol of his wealth, and he is never afraid to use it on his enemies. He is rich from his illegal dealings, and known as Redjaw not just for the color of his beard, but for the blood he frequently gets on his face from slaughter.</li>
            <li>The Breathless Assassins: This influential assassin's guild is rumored to exist in the Haunted Wastes near Modouli, and is hired frequently by the rich and powerful to deal with their enemies.</li>
            <li>Zao, Arch Suffocant: A parental figure to Kestrel, and leader of the mysterious Breathless organization. he was badly wounded in last encounter with the Capable Crew before fleeing through a portal. He is a mysterious figure, and avoids contact with outsiders.</li>

</li>
<li>
    <h2 id="section-haunted-expanse">The Haunted Expanse</h2>
    <p>What was once the focal point of power for the Velki Enclave, a mysterious blight in the past swept through the area, destroyed the civilization, and sullied the oasis around which the city was built. Now, it is a desolate landscape, filled with the ruins of the failed city, mostly buried under eons of blackened sand. The surrounding desert has been formed into a giant blackened crater, and nothing living approaches. Adventurers have ventured there in the past in search of treasure, but none return. Many believe the city to be cursed, and that the corpses of the previous inhabitants still wander the wastes. Mysterious metal “monsters” circle the city every two hours, emitting overwhelming sonic blasts. They appear to be 30 feet long, follow a set path, emit sonic booms by slamming pistons inward, and fly about a foot above the sand. The ruins beneath the sands house mysterious tunnels, undead, and glowing panels with many areas to explore. Many hidden secrets and untold riches likely remain buried beneath the blackened sands, but only the brave or lucky could hope to find some and return alive.</p>

    <h2 id=section-gnomeopolis>Gnomeopolis</h2>
    <img src='https://i.postimg.cc/PrcqZFTY/Gnomeopolis.jpg' alt='Map Gnomeopolis' style='width:900px;'>
    <p>Isolated from the Birunduul empire, this city is built into the western Crast Hills on the shore of Attiwich Loch. All gnomes in the region hail from this area, and mostly keep to themselves. Gnomeopolis is the only civilization on Kamuin thus far to have mastered advanced weapondry such as cannons and firearms, and they guard their technology jealously. The city operates on a heavily mechanized system, with most manual labor being performed by automatons, freeing the small populace to pursue intellectual endeavours. Industry and cleverness drive your social standing in this cuthroat capitalistic society.</p>
    <h3>Important Denizens</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Duchess Elatriss Silentall: An elderly gnommish craftswoman (195 years old), Elatriss governs over Gnomeopolis as the trusted elder. She rose to power by building some of the best sailing vessels for the Imperial fleet in Attiwich Loch, before rolling them across the hills to the Sea.</li>
            <li>Yoskas Sparktoe: Leader of a band of gnomish mercenaries, this wily gnome wears black clothes and a bandana around his head. He subcontracts out bounties on criminals and monsters alike to those willing to align with his band, the Gearbreakers.</li>
            <li>Albert Ernstein: This wild-haired gnome goes by Bert, or Ernie to his friends. A well-informed thief who operates on the streets, he is knowledgeable about previous Nightwalker activity in the region but avoids them. He has a passionate hatred for slavers. He is familiar with all black market activities</li>
            <li>Zanzu Metalseeker: An old wizened gnome with a permanent shock of poofed-out frizzy hair. He has super thick spectacles, and is the leader of a group of mechatronic enthusiasts known as the Industrialists. They innovate constantly, and many strange automaton inventions wander their space in the Temple to Mirrodin. He is old enough to remember the Oré Incident, when the Warforged servants overthrew their masters and migrated to Ikesh. He abhors tech bordering on intelligence.</li>
            <li>Myna Silvertuft: A regal gnome with silver flowing hair and sharp eyes, Myna is Captain of the Dancers, a group of fighters dedicated to the defense of Gnomeopolis, the Duchess, and her people. They rarely use their Gneutralizer suits, instead relying on rapiers and firearms to enforce the law. They are beloved by the good citizens for their selfless service, and joining the Dancers is a great honor.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Gnomeball</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This recent sport has  exploded in popularity,  with the teams from  each faction in the city  vying for renown each  year in the annual tournament. Bets have  never been higher, and  the stakes are high to  acquire the favor of Brillin  and ensure the player's faction being supported by his industry and maintnence for the following year. A match is played between two teams, with 5 players on each side. The ball is a massive iron cannonball, and players inside mech suits kick the ball around the large, dish-shaped arena. To score a point, the players must scoop up the ball into their cannon-like arm and fire it through one of three vertical hoop goals. Once they've scooped it up and are taking aim, they cannot move their feet. The teams cooperate to defend their own goals, move the ball to the other team's goals, and pass the ball to get in an optimal angle to fire and earn a point. The smaller, central goal is worth three points, while the larger, side goals are worth one each. The current active teams are:</li>
            <li>The Gearbreakers: A tight-knit group of mercenaries, successful at protecting private citizens from Orc raids, criminals, and monsters. They are unpopular, but wealthy and respected for their abilities.</li>
            <li>The Rowdy Rodents: A ragtag group of backstreet hooligans who've acquired Gneutralizer suits under questionable circumstances. They are a new addition to the roster, and their pluckiness and creative maneuvers have won them some favor.</li>
            <li>The Dancers: The pilots' formal training and elegant mechs make the Dancers a regular crowd favorite for winning. They also are frequently successful, due to their raw ability. However, they tend to be predictable and sometimes lose to unexpected strategies.</li>
            <li>The Industrialists: The oldest team, this group of inventors always deploy the craziest methods to win the game, and are driven to innovate over win conventionally. Led by Zanzu Metalseeker.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Important Locations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Gnomeball Stadium: A place for celebration. Owned and built by Corkas, bets and gambling are rampant.</li>
            <li>The Whimsical Willow: Local tavern, owner is Daryl</li>
            <li>The Dragon's Dive: A seedy drinking tavern, owned by a congenial gnome named Toris. A greatsword and a large black claw sit over the mantlepiece, placed there by a great paladin who slew a dragon that once threatened the city with that very sword.</li>
            <li>The Bakery District: Filled with tasty pastries and associated with the Gnomeball champions from last year.</li>
            <li>The Cuddly Chemist: A potionseller, the owner is gnome woman named Shella, everything is very cute and horrendously pink.</li>
            <li>The Clockwork Cobbler: Sells mechanized weapons, and generally gives off dodgy vibes.</li>
            <li>Tinker Tower: Home to the Duchess and her glass house. The top is a massive clocktower, a feat and keeps time, tolling every hour.</li>
            <li>Attiwich Docks: Dozens of vessels line the shore, traveling around the lake to fish for food and trade with a couple smaller villages on the perimeter. Fish have been scarce and are weirdly sick, some with extra heads.</li>
            <li>Notia Mines: The source of the mysterious Welbi Shards, the red glowing crystals that currently harvest solar power and provide energy to many of the automatons within the city. The mines are active, but heavily guarded by the Dancers, as no other known sources are as useful or versatile as Welbi Shards.</li>
            <li>Automated Fields: Lumbering robots maintain and harvest crops annually, using greenhouses for perennial crops and windmills for power.</li>
            <li>Temples to Edyno, Dardolin, and Iowana: Library for Iowana, History museum in Edyno and liberal arts/Architect's college, Tinkering fest for Mardolin/the Smithy.</li>

    <img src='https://i.postimg.cc/mZYjc9b5/Attiwich-Loch.png' alt='Attiwich Loch' style='width:600px;'>
    <p>This massive inland freshwater lake breaks the monotony of the rolling Crast Hills, and provides a source of sustenance to most of the inhabitants of the region. Much of the wildlife ecology is based around this body of water. There are rumors of creatures that live in its depths, and many fisherman in the region love to share tales of the Beast, a nameless, amorphous creature that seems to have lived in the Loch for hundreds of years. Most of the wildlife in the Crast Hills has developed asynchronously with the rest of the region, and is generally more aggressive and dangerous to travelers. Orcs have made many of the cave systems their home here, and do not hesitate to slaughter passerby or rival groups of orcs. The easternmost groups bother Swarthmore regularly.</p>
