<p><em><strong>Vivian</strong> walked alongside her companion, glancing around the central thoroughfare of Seabend. She took in sights and smells of the bustling traders, artisans, snake oil sellers, and other travelers in the dense port city. She was reminded of her earliest memory, a faint recollection of seeing the sparkling waters of the Vanjan Sea, smelling the fishy air and strange spices of the trade quarter, all while clinging to the Matron's hand.</em></p>
<p><em>Recalling the Matron Mother, she then reflected on her years growing up on the outskirts of Seabend, and the various abuses she suffered under the old crone's command. Despite her upbringing being sponsored by charitable donations from wealthy benefactors in distant lands, she and the other orphans labored and begged to earn their shelter, while the Matron Mother squandered the funds on darkgrass and vodka for herself.</em></p>
<p><em>These memories of her youth stirred the familiar churning rage within her. Her years of begging on the streets of Seabend, as well as the difficult transition when she had begun to attract the unwanted gazes of sailors and passerby, the jeers from Matron at her growing mottled patches of skin, and the constant hunger as a growing teenager had all shaped her into a hardened youth. She left Seabend after her tenure at the orphanage ended and wandered the northern coasts of the Midlands. She begged, slept in stables, and accepted any work wherever she could find it.</em></p>
<p><em>Vivian had kept the rage bottled up, tightly wound like a coiled spring. She felt it grow with every passing week, sprouting like a gnarled weed from the rocky soil of her unhappy life. One night, while cleaning an empty tavern after hours, the last patrons shuffled out, jeering at her as they went. She felt the rage bloom, billowing outwards, filling her with terrible purpose. As she reached out to everything around her in rage and despair, wanting nothing other than to wipe it all away, her Master stepped into the room. He found her in that empty tavern, and in him, she sensed a kindred spirit immediately. He understood her, on a level no other ever had, and he held her steady with his wisdom and boundless strength. Taking her away from all the horrible people, he transformed her hatred, sharpening it into a vision for the future.</em></p>
<div class="column-break"></div>
<p><em>Returning to the present, Vivian saw her destination come into view. The public house of the Magistrate loomed ahead, and she prepared herself again for the speech she had practiced. Moments later, after she had entered the bustling public space filled with guards and loudly declared her demands for the Magistrate to swear fealty to her Master and join her in their shared vision for a better world, there was a deafening silence. The bustling townsfolk stopped and craned their necks to see the diminutive young woman, and her looming hooded partner standing behind her.</em></p>
<p><em>The Magistrate stood up in his chair at the far end of hall, peering at Vivian. He sneered briefly, and told her to get out of the space, as she was obstructing people's work. She repeated herself, stating that this was the last chance for the people of Seabend to make amends for their failures and debasements, and to join together under the banner of her Master. The Magistrate laughed, and waved for the guards to remove them from the space.</em></p>
<p><em>Vivian felt her anger flaring up, but then she heard her Master whisper to her, in the way that only she could hear. He comforted her, and reminded her to begin the meditation exercises he had taught her. Vivian closed her eyes and focused on the feeling of her own heartbeat, willing it to slow and quiet. Her Master stepped forward, looming between her and the guards. His large presence sheltered her from the judging eyes all around. As he unfolded himself outwards onto the guards, the Magistrate, and all the citizens of Seabend, she continued to count her heartbeats. The screaming began, rolling and echoing around her, the cries of all the people who had wronged her. She strove to not let it distract her focus, and she continued to count heartbeats with determination. She reached a count of 453 before she noticed that all was quiet once more. She opened her eyes, and looked upon her Master again. He turned to her and smiled his reassurance, and together they looked towards the vision of the future she had sworn to make real with his help. She reached out towards the people of Seabend, seeking those who would join them, and making note of all those who could not...</em></p>

<h3 id="prologue-21st-of-isoldre-year-1127-day-1">21st of Isoldre, Year 1127, Day 1</h3>
<p><em>(In the real world, 5 friends gather on <strong>March 18th, 2021</strong> to play an awesome game called Dungeons and Dragons...)</em></p>
<p>At a small, dingy inn on the shore of the <em>Bay of Denalas</em>, a bedraggled and soaking wet man stumbles through the creaky door. He sighs in relief to get inside out of the rain, and his faintly luminescent cerulean eyes glance around the oppressive room. A few halfings sit a table, quietly gambling, while the red dragonborn barkeep polishes a few glasses. A short human woman sits by the fire reading a book, and nearby a looming firbolg converses enthusiastically with a muscular dark elf woman at a table nearby. Satisfied, the man shakes out his cloak, and approaches the barkeep.</p>
<p>"Welcome to the <em>Glowing Hearth Inn</em>!" booms the dragonborn. "My name is Kodrak; what's yours?." The wet man sits down and relaxes a bit, pushing his damp black hair out of his face and tucking it behind his pointed grey ears.</p>
<p>"I go by <strong>Kaz</strong>. Do you have food and lodging?" The dragonborn laughs and affirms that rooms and dinner are indeed available, and Kaz waits to be served. He examines the strangers gathered in the room once again, listening to their conversations.</p>
<p>"It really is a small world!" booms the red-haired firbolg man to the dark elf, who smiles. "Last time we met was what, 20 years ago?"</p>
<p>The woman nods and replies, "It must be fate, to cross paths again. I'm glad to see you're doing well, and I hope your family is too."</p>
<p>This reply seems to sober the firbolg somewhat, and he shrugs. "My family is alright; the forest is getting weird though. There is a <em>Darkness</em> in the forest that is spreading, and I'm here seeking answers. I have no idea what's wrong, but the elders in Oakheart don't seem to consider it a big enough issue to call for aid."</p>
<p>At this time, the dragonborn brings out several plates of food for all the customers. Kaz is served at the bar, while the rest are handed plates. Kaz, not wanting to remain distant, wanders over to the table, and asks, "Mind if I join you?"</p>
<p>The two strangers lean back and nod politely, and Kaz sits with them. "The name is Kaz; do you know each other?" The firbolg laughs and smiles genially, stroking his bushy red beard and saying "Welcome Kaz! My name is <strong>Ser</strong>, and this is my very old acquaintance <strong>Dhamiria</strong>. We met long ago, when I was still a child, while traveling with my family in the <em>Darkspire Mountains</em> to trade."</p>
<p>Dhamiria smiles politely at Kaz, while he tries not to feel intimidated by her impressive physique, braided and beaded white hair and imposing tattoos scrawled across her exposed upper arm. A simple glaive ornamented with a raven's feather sits propped against the back of her chair. She grabs a thick and crusty loaf of bread and rips it in half with casual ease.</p>
<p>As the three of them make small talk and discuss the state of the roads, a sudden shudder runs through the room. A trembling rattles up from deep below, and dust showers down from the ceiling. Half of the people in the tavern jump up in a panic, but the dragonborn inkeep yells out, "No worries! Its just another tremor, it'll pass in a moment."</p>
<p>Indeed, the shaking subsides after only a moment. The human woman previously standing by the fireplace is now standing, staring at the floor in fascination. She whips around to face the three newcomers also standing with a discerning gaze and states "Did any of you see any big fissures or cracks on the road on the way in?"</p>
<p>Kaz shakes his head no, as do the others. The woman joins the people at the table and sits down, tossing her long orange scarf over her should and shaking her brown curls out of her face. She seems excited by the event, and dives into conversation with the rest, questioning the earthquake's origin, and apparently fully acquainted with their names from eavesdropping from the fire.</p>
<p>Dhamiria stops her as she rambles off rhetorical questions about tectonic plates and magical leylines and asks "It seems like you know our names; what did you say yours was?"</p>
<p>The woman blinks her green eyes in surprise and then smiles, declaring "My apologies! I've gotten carried away; my name is <strong>Zephyr</strong>, wizard extraordinaire and aeromancy enthusiast. So, as I was saying..."</p>
<p>As the night wears on, the four travelers talk about their travels, discuss their plans for the near future, and get to know each other. They enjoy herbal tea around the fire, quickly become friends. As they inspect a job posting board, they agree to collaborate on a few tasks the next couple days to earn some coin.</p>

<ul>
<li>The next morning, the four travelers awake and greet each other in the tavern. They inspect the job postings once again and head out into the town to seek employment.</li>
<li>Three jobs seemed the most interesting: guard duty for an archaeologist, pest control for the stablemaster, a lost dog, and gathering wheat from the fields.</li>
<li>Occassional tremors rock the earth around them still, keeping everyone on edge.</li>
<li>Just as the players leave the tavern, a crazed man busts through the door and attacks Zephyr. She managed to levitate him before he did any serious damage, and Kaz knocked him out.</li>
<li>The players take the man to the town lawman, a dwarven man known as <strong>Constable Broderick Gray</strong>. He jails the crazed man and puzzles over where he came from. His grandfather was the founder of Graymoore.</li>
<li>More earthquakes trouble the town. The travelers visit <strong>Stablemaster Thrulda</strong> seeking payment, and learn about giant bugs that have dug a tunnel beneath her stable and stolen a couple of her horses.</li>
<li>The four descended into the tunnels to see if the horses could be rescued. In the dug tunnels below, various cave-dwelling monsters harried them, hurting them badly and forcing them to flee back to the surface.</li>
<li>There, they inspected the Stablemaster's mounts for sale, which included antelope-like mounts and a juvenile moorebounder, a rare and aggressive cat-like mount. Ser and Dhamiria both seemed intrigued by the moorebounder.</li>
<li>Returning to the inn, they encountered <strong>Kelly Seekerton</strong>, the archaeologist returning from her current expedition to the tavern. She is thin and pale with a bowl cut and comically thick glasses. She is a traveling archivist for the <em>Halls of Antiquity</em>, located in the distant city of <em>Vexyll's Pit</em>.</li>
<li>Her last escort service went missing during an expedition. Undeterred, the travelers agree to travel with Kelly back to her dig site. A couple hours of travel away, they follow Kelly to a cave entrance, where she has a magical drill.</li>
<li>Following Kelly into the cave with her drill, she leds them past mysterious ruins and motifs until she finds a spot to resume her drilling.</li>
<li>She breaks through the wall and tells the four to wait behind, but suddenly a horde of horrible Kruthiks appear from the darkness, seeking the intruders. The travelers dove into the narrow tunnel and used illusion magic to mask their escape.</li>
<li>This tenuous disception held long enough for Kelly to quickly teleported them all away to safety.</li>
<li>The group arrived on a ruined battlefield, in a distant land in a region known as the <em>Balmere Plateau</em>. Kelly apologized that her aim was off, and she would bring them back to Graymoore in the morning.</li>

<ul>
<li>After sleeping out in the open on the desolate plains, they woke and returned to Graymoore through Kelly's teleportation.</li>
<li>In Graymoore it was raining torrentially, so Kelly paid the travelers for their trouble and encouraged them to rest.</li>

<ul>
<li>After the rain subsided, they four decided to go earn some money by harvesting wheat in the fields.</li>
<li>Zephyr used her magic to summon multiple invisible servants to do the work for her, while the others labored away manually. She named her servant <strong>Invisibelle</strong>.</li>
<li>After several hours of harvesting, the four were beset upon by two more crazed and ragged individuals. Zephyr thunderwaved them to death, but Kaz was knocked unconscious and was healed by Ser's magic.</li>
<li>The Constable thanked them once again for their help and paid them to bury the bodies outside of town. They carried them there as it began to rain again, and Dhamiria said some words over the gravesite.</li>
<li>After doing this, the players returned to town to the scene of a fourth crazy vagabond (this one a teenage girl) who had attacked the local dockmaster.</li>
<li>Talking it over with the Constable, they determined that these individuals must have been arriving from the direction of <strong>Leafside</strong>, the major city to the south, and that they were wearing scraps of cloth made from silk from the coast to the northeast.</li>
<li>They returned to the tavern to rest and spend some of their gold, discussing the implications of these strange vagabonds.</li>

<ul>
<li>After deliberating, the group decided to return to the tunnels beneath the stables. Making greater progress this time, they fought past several giant spiders and collected a fine silver dagger buried in the dirt.</li>
<li>At the end of the tunnels, they found the corpse of a dog, which had been advertised as missing on the job posting board.</li>
<li>The team was attacked by more Kruthiks, so they crawled back to the surface to rest after the encounter. Then, they dove back down, and made it to the end of the tunnels.</li>
<li>The missing horses were bound in silken cocoons, where larvae had been deposited. The group smashed the larvae and explored a little further, into a massive network of dug tunnels that seemed to stretch forever beneath the village.</li>
<li>They returned to the surface, sealing the tunnel behind them. They collected pay from the stablemaster, and returned the body of the dog to <strong>Ms. Lynn Wares</strong>, the general store owner who had a few children. She was sad, but thanked them and traded basic supplies.</li>
<li>They then visited <strong>Blacksmith Dorru</strong>, a stout halfling man, for repairs and upgrades.</li>
<li>Ser and Dhamirira returned to the stables to try and build up a relationship with the Moorebounder, feeding it snacks and trying to become its friend.</li>
<li>That night, the Constable asked the party to assist in guarding the town in case any more vagabonds showed up. They agreed to help.</li>
<li>As Dhamiria was walking around the perimeter, she was attacked by a crazed dragonborn. She managed to defeat the man, and upon inspecting the body she found tattoos of a ship named the <em>Catalina</em>. <strong>Dockmaster Rita</strong>, the middle-aged woman in charge of the boats in town, identified this as a merchant vessel located in <strong>Seabend</strong>.</li>
<li>With this information, the group began to piece together that these vagabonds seem to be originating from the coast to the northwest, perhaps Seabend. Nothing further occurred that night.</li>

<h3 id="prologue-level-up-2-25th-of-isoldre-day-5">25th of Isoldre (Day 5):</h3>
<ul>
<li>That morning, the Constable relaying information received from Leafside that the vagabonds are being called <strong>Hollows</strong>, as they seem to retain nothing of their former humanity. They are a plague across the Midlands, and are attacking people everywhere.</li>
<li>Kelly Seekerton recovered from the previous trip, and asked for help again. Zephyr demanded more information before helping again, and she revealed that she was investigating ancient civilizations, and that she had an ancient artifact, which she showed them briefly to be a strange spiky polyhedral object.</li>
<li>The group left town with Kelly, but not before stopping to feed the moorebounder again.</li>
<li>The arrived at the caves and proceeded to make a sweep of a different series of passages. The group was attacked by Darkmantles and struggled to fight them off in the magical darkness they summoned.</li>
<li>Eventually they unearthed a hidden passage. Beyond it, a sealed series of rooms included a guardian statue, various corpses, an ornate fountain and some chests.</li>
<li>There, they looted various objects and spell scrolls while Zephyr recorded the arcane code for the teleportation sigil.</li>
<li>The bodies were strange, appearing to belong to a race not currently known. Signage on the walls, in an unknown language similar to elven and dwarvish, translated to <em>"For the Glory of Dhanbaduhr."</em> Based on Kelly's guess, these ruins are over 1400 years old.</li>
<li>The fountain was detected to contain magic, so the group spent several hours trying different approaches to open the brass flower bulb at its center. Kelly shared that sacrifice was a key tenet of these ancient people's culture, so Dhamiria and Kaz used fire magic to hurt each other while standing in the fountain.</li>
<li>This worked, opening to reveal a brass armillary sphere inscribed with various spells. Zephyr snapped this up immediately, and learned it contains multiple divination spells.</li>
<li>Leaving that branch of tunnels, the group returned to the previous dig site of a few days ago. Along the way, they found a chest, which turned out to be a mimic.</li>
<li>Approaching the previous location, they were beset by more Kruthiks, one of which was the size of a car. Kelly pulled out an arcane gun and held her own as the group fought back. They barely managed to push through, and continued to the tunnel that Kelly had carved out previously.</li>
<li>Within the room beyond the tunnel, Kelly grew secretive. Ser convinced her to let him help, so together they descended into a large chamber filled with fallen rocks and rubble.</li>
<li>Ser found some runes but struggled to decipher them, taking note of mention of a <em>"Herrkivindi"</em>, and general instructions of <em>“Upon recharge, deposit the quintessihedron...”</em></li>
<li>Kelly thanked Ser for this, and told him to meet her at Vexyll's Pit if they get the chance. Dismissed, the group left Kelly to her own devices in the dark, ominous room and headed back to the surface.</li>

<ul>
<li>As they walked back to the surface, the ground began to tremble. Rocks fell from the ceiling as the tunnels and ancient ruins fell around them.</li>
<li>A rock fell on Kaz's leg, pinning him, but Dhamiria and Ser lifted it off him and pulled him to safety. The team burst out of the opening just as it collapsed behind them.</li>
<li>As they ran back towards town, a massive fissure split open the earth. Rocks and shrapel rained down around them. Kaz was hit again an fell unconcious, but was healed by Ser's magic ointment.</li>
<li>Eventually the rumbling stopped, and the group staggered back to the tavern, explaining what had happened to the innkeeper, and went to sleep.</li>
<li>Zephyr was too excited to sleep, examining the armillary sphere and learning how it worked. It is an ancient wizard spellbook, with various divination magic contained within. A breeze blew in her window, and she was compelled to go outside. There, she say framed in the moonlight, a floating city in the clouds. Awestruck, she started until it glimmered and faded from sight. She vowed to find it one day.</li>
<li>In Kaz's private room, the fire in the hearth flares up, burning a bright blue. It forms the shape of a mouth, and speaks to him, offering him more power, saying that he has potential. Kaz accepts this free gift, and a purplish pseudodragon crawls out of the fire. Kaz names the familiar <strong>Zehruut</strong>, and quickly learns of his love of hard alcohol.</li>
<li>Ser sleeps, but dreams of home. In his dream, he stands on the balconey, looking out at the forest. Elder Hammond asks what he will do next, and Ser replies that he doesn't know. Suddenly, a darkness is crawling over the treetops, approaching Ser and crowding down on him, all alone. Ser closes his eyes and plays a song, which seems to dispel the darkness. He spends the rest of his dream sitting on a riverbank, enjoying the calm.</li>
<li>Dhamiria also has a dream of home, but she dreams of the frosty peaks of the Darkspire Mountains. A giant raven lands nearby, beckoning her to follow. She does, and it takes her to the peak of the nearby mountain, where she finds a drum. She plays it, and witnesses as a multitude of ghostly figures appear, the closest one resembling her grandmother. They speak to her and swear to protect her on her journey. Her dream falls into quiet rest, feeling strangely comforted.</li>

<li>That morning, the ground groggily ate breakfast in the tavern. Everyone was surprise to meet Zehruut, Kaz's new pseudodragon familiar.</li>
<li>Shouts from outside draw them to the docks, where a strange mass is sighted floating in the bay. Using a telescope, they group sees a figure riding upon it, as it moves away, deeper out into the ocean.</li>
<li>The figure doesn't resemble Kelly Seekerton, but it does seem to be holding one of her bags.</li>
<li>Ser tried to convince some sea turtles to give chase, but only a single land turtle replied to his call.</li>
<li>The floating mass with unknown rider floated away into the sunrise. Confused, the group turned their attention back to gainful employment.</li>
<li>They agreed to help build a fence around Graymoore to defend against the Hollows wandering the region. They spent the day working on the fence.</li>
<li>Dhamiria and Ser spent time bribing the Moorebounder with meat, and agreed to call him <strong>Mittens</strong>. They had essentially decided to buy Mittens, but were holding out until the beast liked them more.</li>

<li>Dhamiria and Ser finally bought Mittens. The Stablemaster gave them riding gear and let them both take test rides, which went relatively smoothly. Zephyr and Kaz also bought horse steeds of their own, as did Ser. They were named <strong>Borasco</strong>, <strong>Shrew</strong>, and <strong>Merlot</strong>.</li>
<li>That night, a horrid wave of <em>Hollows</em> assaulted the village out of nowhere. Ser was on watch, and he frantically called for help while trying to blast them back with all the thunder magic he had.</li>

<li>As the sleeping members rose and ran to help, Kaz sprouted inky black wings, which seemed to burn blue at the edges, and he flew to Ser's aid. Zephyr magically enlarged Dhamiria, and she crushed the Hollows with her glaive.</li>
<li>Ser was overwhelmed by the Hollows climbing the fence and was knocked unconcious, but the remainder were eventually slain by the team and Ser was rescued.</li>
<li>The constable thanked them, and paid them in gold coins and whiskey as thanks. He remarked on the increasing danger from the Hollows, and begged the team to travel to <strong>Leafside</strong> to seek aid from <strong>Drakelord Rolar</strong>, and old friend of his.

<li>That morning the team gathered up supplies, bought a map, and met with Constable Graymoore one last time. He gave them rations for the trip, and asked them to stop by the house of <strong>Old Fenrick</strong>, who he hadn't visited in awhile, on the way.</li>
<li>On the way out of town, the team passed by more fissures in the ground that seemed to have been related to the earthquakes from the days before. Dead kruthiks were scattered everywhere, damaged from the quake.</li>
<li>One massive kruthik had survived, and attacked the group as they were riding. It gave chase, but the team leaped over a fissure, and Ser and Zephyr blasted it back with thunderwave as it jumped, knocking it down into the fissure below.</li>
<li>They traveled to the edge of the Timberlands, and made camp near the treeline. Kaz spent awhile talking with Zehruut, and Dhamiria spent time teaching Mittens how to respond to commands and hunt for food.</li>

<li>While traveling the road, the group encountered an offshoot road with a cabin at the end of it. The cabin was beset by Hollows, so they jumped in to help. Mittens held his own against the monsters.</li>
<li>After dealing with the Hollows, an old half-orc man came out to speak with him. He was Old Fenrick, the friend of the Constable.</li>
<li>Stopping to visit, they delivered the package to Fenrick, which he identified as hard liquor. Strangely, Fenrick also had a pet magic book named Bookvar. The floating boat was able to transform itself into various forms, such as a goat.</li>

<li>Unexpectedly, a strange woman with massively long ears appeared and walks through the space. Ser tries to speak with her, and she insisted upon "watering the crops in the garden."

<li>The team ran in and used magic to convince the ogres that the smallest of them was planning to steal the dwarf for himself.</li>
<li>In the ensuing chaos, Ser and Zephyr use illusion magic to further confuse the ogres, as Dhamiria saved the dwarven teenager from their grasp.</li>
<li>The ogres are defeated, and the dwarf leads them to her family down the road, who were just arriving to rescue her. Making fast friends, the dwarves offer shelter and food as thanks.</li>

<li>He advises them to keep an eye out for an older white-haired dwarf named <strong>Old Silverhands</strong>, a revered local legend for them.</li>
<li>This legendary figure has been seen all the way east and west on the continent, and appeared to those who need help. The chromed silver paint that they wear on their faces is meant as a gesture of good will to him.</li>
<li>Their last piece of advice is to seek out the <strong>Bladewitches</strong>, secretive magic users in the Olmothian Woods who may have insight into the <em>Darkness</em> of Ser's homeland. They are known for their distinctive double-sided polearms.</li>

<li>Entering through the gates, the team see the city of Leafside sprawling ahead of them. Ser spots a firbolg, and quickly strikes up a conversation. The nice man suggests they go to the Cerulean Garrison with the news from Graymoore, and to meet him for dinner at the Stone Kayak.</li>
<li>They travel to the Garrison and are granted an audience with <strong>Drakelord Rolar</strong>, an intimidating firbolg woman with an eyepatch and serious demeanour.</li>
<li>She is concerned about Graymoore, but explains that she is stretched thin dealing with several issues around Leafside.</li>
<li>She shares that the Hollows are coming from the East, probably the city of Laudron.</li>
<li>A trade baron named <strong>Molgar Darkbrow</strong> is anxious to resolve the issue to resume inter-city trade.</li>
<li>A goblin menance known as the <strong>Re-Emboweler</strong> has been attacking Hollows and citizens alike.</li>
<li>Incessant clattering has been keeping everyone awake at night, and it seems to be emenating from the ruins at the center of the Lake. No expedition has been able to pinpoint the source yet, and its irritating everyone.</li>
<li>The general gossip is that Hollows are just normal people that have somehow been brainwashed and let loose on the Midlands.</li>
<li>The town drunk, <strong>Tormod McLeary</strong>, is often in touch with rumors, and loiters around the center of town. Bring him drink, and he will talk.</li>
<li>With all of these leads, the team promises to lend aid to Drakelord Rolar, freeing up some of her guard so that she can send them to Graymoore. She thanks them, and the team leaves to have dinner.</li>
<li>After a nice dinner with the firbolg, they are approached by two imposing individuals, who introduce themselves as <strong>Soliana</strong> and <strong>Otis</strong>. They belong to the <strong>Order of the Grasping Fist</strong>, and ask the team to keep their eyes peeled for a gnome with a purple mohawk, named <strong>Vorros</strong>.</li>

<li>Apparently, the <strong>Choice Cuts Corporation</strong> (<strong>CCC</strong>), a banking firm with a branch in town, has a bounty out for this gnome.</li>
<li>The pair suggest the gnome is disguised with a magic hat. They offered the group money in exchange for any leads about his location.</li>
<li>That night, as the group went to sleep, more horrific, twisted shapes began to crawl out of the hander haversack. Zephyr felt paralyzed, and was barely able to wake up before the creature crawled out.</li>

<li>After buying coffee drinks, the group followed Zephyr to the Sparklight Chantry to seek curse removal. Within, they found multiple shrines to the different deities.</li>
<li>A caretaker named Friar Luke informed them that Friar Whambeg, the senior cleric, was out visiting the apiary outside town and had yet to return.</li>
<li>Zephyr spent some time reading, while the others suggested they visit the isle in the center of the lake, where they had all heard the clattering coming from the night before.</li>
<li>The dwarven girl they had rescued from the ogres gifted them a pendant of dwarvenkind, and thanked them again as her family moved on from Leafside.</li>
<li>On the way to the docks, a suspicious halfling bumped into Zephyr. She immediately checked, and he had stolen her scrolls. A chase ensued, and the halfling jumped into an enchanted canoe and flew off towards the center of the lake.</li>
<li>Ser magically created long canoe for the team, while Dhamiria rowed and Kaz flew, towing the boat along to give chase.</li>
<li>The halfing's magic rowboat beat them to the island, and he dissappeared into the ruins as they approached. Exploring the ruins, the team fought off several rust monsters and an ankheg that were in cages rigged to open when they entered the room.</li>
<li>Kaz's sword was destroyed by the rust monsters, and almost died in the process. Ser healed him back. The group then explored the remainder of the ruins for loot.</li>
<li>They found a statue in a dried out fountain in the center of the keep ruins with a riddle that seemed unsolvable.</li>
<li>At the back end of the ruins, they found a chapel that had crumbled into the lake. It was suspicious, and after a thorough inspection, they found that the rocks falling down the hole made the exact same clattering noise everyone kept hearing at night.</li>
<li>Ser tried to convince anyone who could be listening that they were friends. While this didn't do anything, Ser did notice a flicker of movement out of the corner of his eye.</li>
<li>Following this, the team discovered an illusory wall leading to a network of carved tunnels beneath the ruins. Evidence of excavation and broken rock explained the noises, as rocks would be dumped into the lake and clatter down the cliffside.</li>
</ul>

<li>Chained owlbears attacked the group as they explored deeper. Ser managed to scare them away with illusions, and kept them at bay that way.</li>
<li>They disarmed multiple traps along the way, and noticed the numerous chests filled with decorative geodes and rocks. At the back of the cave systems, they found a room with some furniture.</li>
<li>Kaz noticed that the table was illusory, and the fugitive burst out from hiding behind it. Dhamiria quickly restrained him, and reveals the man to be <strong>Vorros</strong>, the gnomish rogue wanted by the CCC, after removing his hat of illusion.</li>
<li>Vorros explains that the CCC wants him because of his exorbitant gambling debts. He claims to have read a manuscript in Drakkengrad about a treasure located here on this isle, so he is excavating and steal to try and raise enough money to pay off his debts.</li>
<li>Wanting to also find the treasure, the team gets to work digging as well. Eventually, through magic and might, they unearth what appears to be a massive geode, buried deep in the rock beneath the ruins. It had an intense abjuration aura, and is unidentifiable otherwise. Deciding to turn in the gnome and let it be, the team returned to Leafside.</li>
<li>Instead of handing the fugitive over the Order of the Grasping Fist, who requested him, the team takes him straight to the CCC to collect on the bounty. They successfully evade the inspections of Soliana and Otis, who suspect them, with illusion magic and convincing lies.</li>
<li>After some shopping, they head to bed at the tavern. Zephyr is accosted once again by the magical demon in the bag, despite sleeping in a different room. She barely wakes up in time, despite feeling its cold breath on her neck.</li>

<li>The next morning the team beelined for the Chantry to seek aid for Zephyr. They learned that Friar Whambeg was still missing, and may have fallen astray of some trouble.</li>
<li>The group decides to ride out to the Apiary Fields and seek him. They gathered their mounts and went west. Along the route, the encountered horrible wooden displays along the road, draped in viscera and bowels. They quickly rode past.</li>
<li>At the fields, they found that hundreds of bees had been turned to stone, falling into the flowers below. The trail of stone bees led the group to a nearby cave, where they witnessed a basilisk chewing on a stone leg.</li>
<li>They ambushed it, crushing it before anyone was subjected to its gaze, submerging it in magical darkness. In the cave, they found a statue of Friar Whambeg, too late to save him from being petrified.</li>
<li>They gathered him into a cart and returned to Leafside. They noticed the guts on display had been removed, with no apparent reason.</li>
<li>The team dropped off the statue of Friar Whambeg at the Chantry, as well as the basilisk corpse. Friar Luke stated he would get to work on distilling a remedy from the corpse with the help of the local alchemist.</li>
<li>That night, Zephyr didn't sleep. She was too paranoid to rest, afraid of what might come out of the bag.</li>

<li>Everyone bought fancy coffee drinks, and Ser purchased several healing kits. Kaz bought a new sword to replace his broken one.</li>
<li>Dhamiria made friends with an elven smith named <strong>Elvara Krismus</strong>. She was very curious about Dhamiria's glaive, and the smithing techniques used to forge it. Ser sold Elvara the geodes that the team had collected, and she sharpened Dhamiria's glaive for her.</li>
<li>They visited the tavern to buy some booze for Zehruut, and then sought out Tormod McLeary in the town square. Ser summoned a magical vat of moonshine for him, and he gladly told the group everything he knew.</li>
<li>They learned from Tormod that the Re-Emboweler is an evil goblin raider. They also learned about the <strong>Ox</strong> is a powerful man, seeking to conquer the continent, and that he has a representative hiding in town, who showed Tormod a vision of the Ox.</li>
<li>The group headed out of town to seek the Re-Emboweler. They eventually found some goblins and defeated them, following their trail into the deeper woods to a goblin encampment.</li>
<li>The Re-Emboweler made himself known, and it became obvious that he was a Nilbog, a cursed and powerful chaotic magic goblin.</li>
<li>After a difficult fight, during which the spirit of the Nilbog jumped from goblin to goblin, avoiding death, the team managed to kill it by destroying the blood-red cap that it wore. Zehruut and Mittens were put to good use, killing goblins left and right and helping the team.</li>

<li>They returned to Leafide and slept in the tavern. Zephyr slept in the Chantry, hoping for protection, but the creature attacked her in her sleep once again.

<li>That morning the group talked about the issue of the Bagman, and decided to wait for Friar Whambeg to be revived. They headed to the Drakkeep to speak with Rolar and collect their rewards for the Re-Emboweler and the Clattering Keep.</li>
<li>Rolar was impressed with their work and re-assessed their value. She paid them, but was still unwilling to share any information about the Ox. She did tell them that he was a warlord that may be linked to the decimation of the city of <strong>Laudron</strong>.</li>
<li>The team visited the coffee shop, caffeinating for the day. After some unproductive reading in the library about Bladewitches and nightmare monsters, they sought out Darkbrow, the dwarven trade baron.</li>
<li>He offered the group a job as guards for a shipment to Arkalon, the neighboring city to the east. The caravan was scheduled to leave on the 12th. The Drakelord of Arkalon, <strong>Drakelord Shasa</strong>, would pay them when they arrived.</li>
<li>Darkbrow also revealed that all the hollows seem to be former denizens of Laudron and Seaside, two cities that have recently gone dark.</li>
<li>Ser and Dhamiria bride a guard to grant them access to see baby blue drakes, which are very, very cute.</li>

<div class="column-break"></div>
<p><em>You are standing in a snowy field surrounded by trees. Before you, a beautiful structure carved from sculpted stone lies ahead. The architecture is foreign, but expertly crafted, almost organic in the lines of the walls and the slope of the roof. It consists of a central structure with a taller tower attached beyond it. As the snow falls gently down around you, you hear a crunching noise. You turn, and see a humanoid figure approaching, with a furred, elongated hood around the face. As you look beneath the hood, you see a cold-looking woman, with dark green skin and tremendously long ears. She looks through you, past you, not even seeing you. She gazes up towards the tower, and the expression on her face is one of concern. You see faintly glowing lines in intricate patterns across her face, too delicate and detailed to decipher their significance. She walks towards the entrance to the building, running her hand along a wooden fence surrounding a barren patch of exposed earth untouched by the falling snow…</em></p>
<p><em>You follow the woman into the structure. Inside it is warm and filled with more expertly crafted furniture in the same style as the building. Many of the devices sitting on tables are alien to you, their purpose and function unknowable. You wish to look closer, but the woman hurries along, dropping the cloak on the table and stepping into a small cylindrical room at the end of the hall. You are drawn along with her, helpless, and watch as the lower room falls away from sight as the small room lifts upwards within the tower. It slows smoothly to a stop at the top, and the woman steps out into a circular room, where another humanoid turns to face her. This one seems to be a man of the same race, but with a more blueish tint to his skin. The two embrace and share words in a language you cannot understand. The woman seems upset, while the man attempts to console her. Your eyes are drawn away from the two, and they seem magnetically drawn to a glass bell jar on the countertop, surrounded by arcane instruments and tubes. Within, a swirling dark mass of cloud and shadow gently circulates. As you gaze at it, two points of light flicker into being within the fog and stare back…</em></p>
<p><em>You are now looking from within the glass jar, outwards into the tower room. You feel calm and comfortable, and you wait patiently for your creator to return. A day later, your awareness is roused by raised voices. The creator and his partner burst into the room from the elevator, shouting at each other in raised voices. You feel confusion. The creator rushes around the room, grabbing items and talking hurriedly to the partner. He drags a box out into the middle of the room and begins to toss things into it. The room is filled with a sudden flare of orange light, pouring in from the window. Through the thick glass, you can barely see a swirling, twisting pattern to the light, and both the people in the room shout out as the floor shudders. The creator spins to you, grabbing your jar from the table it rests on. His voice rings out in your mind, telepathically clear for an instant:</em></p>
<p><em>“I’m moving you somewhere safe for now. Wait for me; I’ll let you out soon, but for now you must be alone. I’m sorry, little one.”</em></p>

These intense emotions are the last thing you sense as the jar is opened, and you are poured into a dark, empty and cold void.</em></p>
<p><em>You wait.</em></p>

<p><em>An eternity of solitude.</em></p>

<li>While Zephyr experienced this vision of another time and another place, she was possessed by the <strong>Bagman</strong>. Smoke swirled off her body, and the team had to attack to keep her at bay. Evnetually, Ser managed to knock the bagman from Zephyr, and they managed to trap it inside a barrel with Dhamiria. After a tense few moments, as Friar Whambeg stumbles out of his stone prison and lent aid to the battle, the Bagman was banished as Zephyr choked it with a Chill Touch spell.</li>

<h3 id="prologue-level-up-5-people-of-the-midlands"><em><strong>"PEOPLE OF THE MIDLANDS!"</strong></em></h3>
<p>(A booming voice resounds through you minds. An immense presence swells within your minds eye, taking the form of a set of glowing blue eyes, with horns curling around an indistinct face.)</p>
<p><em>"I come to you now, speaking through my humble servant, to bring you tidings of the dawning of a new age."</em></p>
<p><em>"I welcome you to this new era. You have undoubtably seen the sad remnants of humanity stumbling through the woods and hills, preying upon anything in their way. They are what is worst about all peoples: savagery, hunger, selfishness, being driven solely by instinct and greed. They are all that's left in a person once their humanity is gone."</em></p>
<p><em>"I claim full responsibility for these husks, these hollow beings. They were vetted by the same trial that I will bring to all peoples, a trial that found them lacking. My servant you see before you is one of the chosen few who has passed through the fire, and now stands on the other side, ready to lead all the worthy into tomorrow..."</em></p>
<p>(You see rapid-fire images of many determined people, standing proud and firm: this red-headed dwarf, an young drow woman with vittiligo, a human man and women with brown hair wearing rags, holding each others hand and spears in their hands, and others).</p>
<p><em>"My message is this: <strong>Rejoice</strong>! I bring all the worthy peoples of the Midlands a new beginning, an opportunity to bring forth strength in those able to wield it. I also bring a necessary evil, a culling of the weak and those distained by fate, so that the chosen few may repopulate the world and bring it into a new era of peace and connection that the world has never even considered possible."</em></p>

<p><em>"I am <strong>the Ox</strong>. I was deemed worthy by fate to weild a skill greater than any the world has yet seen. I am the unceasing strength that will pull all peoples out of the mud of our primitive prior existence and drag all of us into a new future where we may all rejoice in unity, without false gods, without division and political lines. Harness yourselves to the yoke of progress, and together we will transform the world."</em></p>
<p><em>"Seek me, and I will bring you truth. Abandon your leaders, for all they can give you is more of the same failings. We will drag humanity into the future regardless of what they believe, and all the worthy are welcome in this utopia."</em></p>
<p>(The Ox's attention shifts to the red-haired dwarf, and others similarly standing in courtyards and taverns elsewhere.)</p>
<p><em>"Thank you, my dear servants. You are equals in my sight, and your sacrifices will never be forgotten. We all thank you."</em></p>
<p>(A multitude of voices and emotions, an overwelling of gratitude and appreciation).</p>
<p><em>"Now, to those who are still listening: the unworthy crave what the worthy have. Guard yourselves, for the unworthy will come, seeking a taste of the power that I wield through my servant now. If you survive the trials ahead, you last trail awaits you in my Prescence. Seek me at Hillfar,  and I will give all the strong and the brave their best chance to surpass the trial that awaits you all."</em></p>
<ul>
<li>As the message ended, and Zephyr struck down the dwarf channeling the Ox's message, the team and the rest of Leafside staggered back to their feet.</li>
<li>Dazed and confused, they all spoke together and ruminated on what they had just heard. At that moment, warning bells rang out, signaling an attack on Leafside.</li>
<li>They ran to the outer walls, and witnessed dozens, hundreds, of Hollows running out from the surrounding forests and charging towards Leafside. They began to pile up against the walls, shaking them and threating to break through.</li>
<li>Kaz flew over the swarm, raining down Eldritch Blasts, while Zephyr and Ser used Thunderwave to knock them back. Dhamiria sprinted off to grab Mittens from the stables, and she met up with Rolar and several other Drakkenguard ready to charge out through the front gate and meet the Hollows head on.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.gmbinder.com/images/Gzx8XdL.png" style="position:absolute;bottom:-60px;left:-10px;width:460px"></p>
<div class="column-break"></div>
<ul>
<li>In the chaos that ensued, Dhamiria and Mittens slashed down many Hollows alongside the people of Leafside and Rolar astride her giant, lightning-breathing Blue Drake.</li>
<li>Hollows broke through the wall, and Zephyr and held the line with Clouds of Daggers and thunderwaves to push them back.</li>
<li>The battle only lasted a few minutes, but in that time the team was responsible for slaying 128 Hollows. After the majority of them were dealt with, Ser ran outside and began to heal the wounded soldiers, saving over 22 of them.</li>
<li>The group waited for awhile, but eventually returned to sleep, utterly drained mentally and physically from the Battle of Leafside. From this day, the team became known locally as the Legends of Leafside, for their heroism and might in defending the walls from the Hollow threat.</li>

<ul>
<li>In the week that followed, Darkbrow felt obliged to reward the group a reward for their valiant defense in the form of rare inks and paper, as well as coin. Rolar also thanked the group, granting them a badge with tanned blue drake hide upon it, a symbol of her approval and gratitude.</li>
<li>The team packed up and left Leafside,  joining the caravan to Arkalon, and acting as its guards along the road into the Stygian Swamp.</li>
<li>A few blue drake riders accompanied them as guards.</li>
<li>On the second day, the group encountered a wandering salesman, a hobgoblin named Walt. The group pooled their resources to buy a magic drum for Ser.</li>
<li>On the fourth day, a giant crocodile attacked from the standing pools of water, eating Kaz's horse, Shrew. It dragged the poor creature into the swamp, and the caravan ran away, leaving Kaz to walk on foot.</li>
<li>On the fifth day, a zealous cleric of Pelor was found to have gathered a small group of people along the road to witness the public burning of Hollows they had captured. He yelled about the end times, and sought to cleanse Athendria of the "sullied creatures."</li>
<li>The group noticed one of the Hollows, may in fact just be a scared and mute young girl. They intervened, using magic to scare off the cleric's gang, and saved the young hobgoblin girl from a terrible fate.</li>
<li>On the sixth day, Hollows and Giant Toads attacked the caravan. One of the Hollows climbed into the cart, pulling out a necklace of fireballs and chewing through it, immolating the middle cart. Mittens was swallowed whole by a giant toad, but Dhamiria and Zephyr saved him. Overall, it was a tough and dangerous battle, but they saved most of the caravan.</li>
<li>At the end of the 7th day, the group finally arrived at <strong>Arkalon</strong>. They found the girl's parents and returned her to them, and then headed to the center of town to report the local Drakelord, <strong>Shasa</strong>.</li>

<ul>
<li>After rolling into <strong>Arkalon</strong> at dusk, the team took note of the rustic setting. Huts and thatched houses lie scattered across the swampy terrain.</li>
<li>Well-equipped hobgoblins roam everywhere, some riding on black drakes. The black drakes are more squat and lizard-like, with low curling horns.</li>
<li>At the Drakkeep, <strong>Drakelord Shasa</strong> greeted them in a mead-hall like entry room. She is small, but imposing in her black armor and face mask covering her acid-burned face. She wields a heavy warhammer.</li>
<li>After telling Shasa about the cultists on the road, she dispatched a squad of her warriors to "deal" with them. She thanks the group for their escort, and pays them.</li>
<li>After some doubt, she asks Kaz for help with interrogating a Reznor spy they captured, as it will be one way he can demonstrate his loyalty and that he is not a threat to Arkalon.</li>
<li>After leaving, Zephyr had a surprise encounter with <strong>Typhon</strong>, her old hobgoblin schoolmate from Lysanor. He was excited to see her, explaining that he was visiting family in Arkalon, and planning on making an expedition to the Darkspire Mountains soon to follow a lead he had on some ancient ruins.</li>
<li>Zephyr agreed to help, once they leave town.</li>

<li>After visiting the various stores, the group learns more about Moorbounder preferences and what they like. Dhamiria got better at controlling Mittens.</li>
<li>The team went spelunking in a nearby cave to collect rare mushrooms for a magic user known as <strong>Mistress Ebony</strong>, who studied under <em>Archmage Stroboghast</em> in Calcimony.</li>
<li>After that, they explore a dense thicket populated with Displacer Beasts. They slayed the monsters, and brought back a couple of hides to Mistress Ebony. She trades them a displacer cloak, which Zephyr wears.</li>
<li>Having earned some spending money, the group stocks up on supplies. Ser and Kaz trained with the Hobgoblins in the morning.</li>

<ul>
<li>The trip to the ruins in the Darkspires was 3 days away, followed by a long climb. The team prepared and purchased cold weather gear.</li>
<li>That night, Drakelord Shasa approached the group incognito, and thanked them for helping out around town. She shared shocking news, that the city of <em>Hillfar</em>, home of the white drakes, had fallen to the might of the <strong>Ox</strong>. <strong>Drakelord Beckuss</strong>, the minotaur leader there, was presumed dead.</li>
<li>Also concerning, was that <em>Drakelord Tyre</em>, the leader of the city of <em>Roxton</em>, home of the green drakes, had stopped responding to communication.</li>
</ul>
<div class="column-break"></div>
<ul>
<li>Shasa was concerned he may be entertaining thoughts of betrayal. She asked the team to investigate on her behalf in Roxton, and to try to prevent any further incursion from the <strong>Ox</strong>.</li>
<li>She gave the group a sending stone, a tool for communication with her in the future. She also gave them black drakehide patches, to match their blue ones, as a gesture of her approval.</li>
<li>Her last gift was a pouch containing 500 platinum, as "persuasive collateral" should Drakelord Tyre need additional persuasion.</li>

<li>The short trip was mostly uneventful, save for a few attacks from will-o-wisps in the swamps.</li>
<li>On the third day, the group met a tabaxi monk named Brightclaw, a member of the Order of Brotherhood. He played music with Ser, and the group relaxed.</li>

<li>Waking to an icy morning, the team pushed on. An icy lake and razor-sharp rock fields presented further challenges, but they persevered.</li>
<li>At one point, a yeti threw rocks at them before dashing away into the falling ice and snow.</li>
<li>They eventually reached the mountaintop, and saw a small, frozen tower sitting inertly. A sign over the doorway labeled the ruins as "Outpost 213."</li>
<li>Entering, they were attacked again by the Yeti, which had made the tower its home. A short and brutal battle ensued, where the team managed to scare it into the basement with fire magic, but not before it blasted them all with its horrible ice breath. The cold was so immense, everyone but Typhon, who was sheltering behind Dhamiria, fell unconcious.</li>
<li>They woke again, healed by Typhon and made a fire to keep warm.</li>
<li>Not wanting to give the beast a chance to recover, they descended into the basement of the tower to finish it off.</li>
<li>After succeeding, they took their rest in Ser's safe magic Tiny Hut, nursing Snecko back to health from his near brush with death from the cold (lizards don't do well in the ice and snow).</li>

<ul>
<li>After waking, the team explored the tower. Starting in the basement, they found a dusty laboratory with some kind of cage containing the bones of a long-dead dragon-like creature. Kaz harvested some yeti fur from the corpse, and Zephyr inspected an old pile of crystals.</li>
<li>Using a machine like a treadmill, Kaz charged up a few of the empty crystals, making them glow pinkish.</li>
<li>Using these crystals, the team was able to power the ruins, giving light to the scene.</li>
<li>On the main floor, Ser summoned a pile of meat to placate some trapped ice wolves in an adjacent room, which likely belonged to the Yeti.</li>
<li>He found stashed in another side room some magic goggles, as well as a strange device labeled as <em>The Potionator.</em></li>
<li>On the top floor of the tower, a massive telescopic appartatus began to spin after powering the floor with a crystal.</li>
<li>A display flickered on, taking measurements before displaying data about weather around the entire planet of Athendria. It took special note of three regions, highlighting them with the following text:
<ul>
<li><em>The Isles of Gravitaas</em></li>
<li><em>Southwest of Ikesh, in the middle of the ocean (labeled ???)</em></li>
<li><em>NorthWest of Ikesh and slowly moving (labeled Stjarnaheim)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The outpost was last online in the year 597 PC.</li>
</ul>
<div class="column-break"></div>
<ul>
<li>After that, the group spent the rest of the day extensively researching the ancient books on the walls, trying to learn more. They found a map of the location of other outposts across the Midlands, as well as notes on the Sundering, and ancient cataclysm that changed the face of the planet.</li>
<li>They learned about Stjarnaheim, the ancestral home of the Cloud Giants, who are known to be very hostile to outsiders.</li>

<li>The team ate a steaming pile of bacon that Ser summoned, which Eoras took part in with gusto. He told the group a story in exchange.</li>
<li>After some conversation, it turned out to be <strong>Old Silverhands</strong>, the legendary dwarf wanderer that is hailed by the silverfaced dwarves that the group had helped on the road to Leafside some weeks past.</li>
<li>Later on during the descent, Dhamiria was struck by horrific bad luck and had a boulder land on and crush her leg, causing a permanent injury.</li>
<li>Eventually the team arrived back at the mountain's base, reuniting with their animals and mounts. Typhon lost a couple toes to frostbike, and Dhamiria's leg healed poorly. The group continues on the road towards Roxton, their mountain adventure complete. Typhon parted ways with the group, returning to Arkalon to process his findings.</li>

<li>Continuing east towards Roxton, the group avoided trouble. They saw a wild pack of Moorbounders, but evaded them</li>
<li>On the first day of the Summer Solstice, the group encountered an elven man smoking a spectacular pipe.</li>
<li>He introduced himself as Ranvig, a traveling magic tattoo artist. Dhamiria received a tattoo of Mittens to match her others, while Ser got a cluster of forest animals and Kaz got a magic circle around the strange brand mark on his chest.</li>
<li>Zephyr bought a scroll of Absorb Elements off of Ranvig instead of a tattoo.</li>
<li>Arriving at Roxton, the group was harassed by unpleasant roadside ruffians, but Ser managed to talk his way out of conflict. They team walked into the small city, noting the large fort at the center, and the clustered buildings and shady people all around it.</li>

<li>The next morning, the group returned to the entrance of the fighting ring and paid for entry, descending into the <strong>Proving Pit</strong>.</li>
<li>The Rules of the Proving Pit: No magic, no weapons, and the last one standing wins. Each day there is a cash prize for the winner of 200 gold.</li>
<li>As the team watched, it became obvious that most participants were cheating in subtle ways.</li>
<li>Dhamiria added herself to the roster, and entered the ring against a halfling man named Mudfeet the Swift. She dominated the first fight.</li>
<li>After a short rest, her second opponent was <strong>Thickjaw Widefist</strong>, the massive goliath bouncer who had let them in earlier that day. Ser utilized a wide variety of vocal tricks to distract Thickjaw, and Dhamiria made quick work of him.</li>
<li>Ser applied some medical ministrations to Dhamiria, getting her back into fighting shape.</li>
<li>Her third opponent, <strong>Ripfang the Eager</strong>, was a tough fight. The gnoll came out clawing and biting, and kept Dhamiria on her toes, but she punched back, hard.</li>
<li>In the championship round, a mysterious contender known as <strong>Ova</strong> arrived, late to the bout. After they removed their helmet and entered the ring, Ova was revealed to be a half-orc woman of considerable strength. Dhamiria was immediately smitten, but didn't let that affect her focus.</li>
<li>The following fistfight was prolonged, with both Dhamiria and Ova resorting to sneaky magic tactics to get through. Dhamiria barely eked out a victory, and as the crowd cheered, she helped Ova up. Ova wiped off the blood and asked if they would be available for dinner.</li>

<li>The tavern owner throws a few people through a large stained glass window, which immediately heals itself.</li>
<li>Over dinner, Ova explains she is a knight of the <em>Order of the Gilded Rose</em>, from the city-state of Bulghraz. She is on the lookout for her friend <strong>Sir Maynard the Mighty</strong>, a bare-chested dwarf with a curved horn helmet who missed their rendezvous with Dame Ova.</li>

<li>The Festival of Warmth is ongoing, so the the team decides to visit the nearby refugee camp with Ova and speak with some of the poor folk. There, they meet a necromancer performing healing on the refugees named <strong>Bloodrinker Painbringer Slaughterkiller the Fourth</strong> (BSPF for short). He is trying to establish a flower shop nearby, and encourages the team to come visit for the festival.</li>
<li>Ser trudges around healing refugees from the Laudron and Hillfar disasters. A couple of the refugees, named <strong>Glint</strong> and <strong>Balfor</strong>, discuss their experiences with the Ox and his crew in Laudron. Ser does his best to help out and the refugees clearly appreciate the effort.</li>
<li>The group visited a dubious resale shop and purchaes some quality (and likely stolen) clothes from a goblin tailor.</li>
<li>Afterwards, the team went to the central fort to seek an audience with <strong>Drakelord Tyre</strong>. After speaking with them, they learned that the Drakelord was contemplating who to support, and would decide based on who resolved their issues with the local gangs by removing the gang leaders.</li>
<li>The leader of the <em>Acid Fangs</em> gang is <strong>Nubtail</strong>, a tabaxi that uses drake venom and hangs out in a warehouse in <em>Backstab Alley</em>. We could sneak in with a transport of special caviar or we could bribe some of his guys to get a face to face. The leader of the* Green Scales* gang is apparently named <strong>Karyl,</strong> and she has ties with the underground drake racing ring.</li>
<li>At the tavern, the team met with some <em>Bladewitches</em> that were working with BSPF to help heal and interrogate the refugees. They gave Ser some ingredients to synthesize some rare poison, and instructions on how to brew it, after the group told them all they knew of happenings in the area and lore about the ruins in the Darkspires.</li>
<li>Ser and Zephyr decided to mix the poison in their room at the inn.</li>
<li>Dhamiria and Kaz tromped over to the emerald garrison to get more info on the caviar shipment. They successfully acquired the rights to be the guards for the entry into town. They then visited <em>Floral Laurels</em> to buy some flowers from BSPF.</li>
<li>That evening at dinner, we ran into Ova and discussed visiting the gang lords tomorrow to help her find her friend. Dhamiria begins to make efforts at flirting with the paladin.</li>

<li>Kaz volunteers to let Dhamiria hang out with Ova all night while the others handle the poisoning effort. Fortunately, (or unfortunately?) they had a nice evening, but Dhamiria was able to rejoin the group before they left to monitor the road.</li>
<li>The first wagon comes down the road, a heavily armored wagon covered in spikes. It is driven by an older gentleman. We do a thorough inspection and discover no caviar.</li>
<li>A second cart comes down the road, this one outfitted with the same large pointy spikes as well and with two drivers. After some investigation, the team identified the caviar compartment and slyly poisoned it with the poison using Ser's animated rock. Then the team bailed and spend the night at the inn.</li>

<li>The next morning, the team goes to inform Drakelord Tyre that they had successfully poisoned Nubtail's caviar. Tyre thanked them and commanded their guards to begin infiltrating Backstab Alley. As the team left, they ran into the envoys of the Ox, who were just arriving to also speak with Tyre. Kaz sent in Zehruut to spy on the meeting.</li>
<li>The leader appears to be a young drow woman named <strong>Vivian</strong>. She declares that they had dealt with the threat posed by Karyl. As the envoys left, the team confronted them. Zephyr insulted Vivian on her vitiligo skin condition, and Vivian forced her to experience some of the suffering she had endured as a child and teenager because of it through a spontaneous psychic connection.</li>
<li>Moments later, Kaz rashly decides to jump into action, diving into combat and grabbing Vivian, flying her up to a great height in an attempt to drop her. This ends very poorly; Vivian flys away from him with ease, then blasts him with a powerful lightning bolt. Kaz falls and barely survives. After a very tense moment facing down the envoys in the streets, Vivian defuses the situation before walking away, encouraging the team to join the Ox, as they have potential for passing his test.</li>

There, they are confronted by a thug who claims that Nubtail has perished from a bad case of the tummy-aches. He demands the group hand over their cash, and Kaz promptly assaults him, triggering a huge rush of thugs to charge into the fray.</li>
<li>Everyone defends themselves, and Ser summons a bunch of wild horses out of nowhere that crowd the alley. The thug leader summons a hailstorm, but Kaz manages to force half of them to flee with the Mace of Terror he was loaned by Tyre.</li>
<li>After the encounter, the team takes the bandit leader captive and interrogates him. He leads them to a warehouse where Maynard is being kept as a bargaining tool. Heavily armed dragonborn confront them, but Ser manages to calm one of them while the rest evade the other. Dhamiria sees some thugs running down a side alley with a wriggling sack, and chases them down on Mittens.</li>
<li>The thugs turn over Maynard, who is furious at his treatment, but grateful to the team and Ova for rescuing him. As the group leaves Backstab Alley, chaos ensues around them as Drakelord Tyre's gang moves in and begins to exert control over the leaderless gangs.</li>
<li>That night, everyone gets to know Maynard, another of the Knights of the Gilded Rose. To celebrate, everyone visits the Butter Churn to try their famous green butter, which induces an unpleasant hallucinogenic state.</li>
<li>Ova and Dhamiria sleep on the floor to let it wear off, and wake up rather close. It is awkward, but in a good way.</li>

<li>The morning is spent in training, before the group seeks out the Drake races to try their hand at gambling. Ser cheats quite a bit to boost one of the racers, and the team manages to win some gold.</li>
<li>Zephyr spots one of the thugs that reports to Karoyl, and the team follows him to her hideout beneath the racing track. There, despite being surrounded, they attempt to bargain with Karoyl.</li>
<li>After much impassioned debate, everyone manages to convince Karoyl to leave Roxton with her followers, as opposed to siding with Vivian and waiting for Tyre to be overthrown. Vivian appears to be working both sides, promising success to each if they support the Ox. cutting through these lies helped Karoyl see that there is very little chance of success if she stays.</li>
<li>Returning to Tyre, the group relayed their success. Tyre is confused, but them figures out that they were lied to with a false vision by the Ox.</li>
<li>Tyre is pissed, but thanks the team for removing their rivals and bringing to light this deception. They agree to support the other Drakelords in their fight against the Ox.</li>

<li>The team spends the day training some more, visiting BSPF's flower collection, and Dhamiria pays a rogue to teach her how to better move stealthily.</li>
<li>Kaz receives a strange message from Zehruut, telling him to meet an "associate" outside of town that night. He goes out on his own, and on the road outside town he is attacked by a group of Hollows. After a moment of panic, an armored figure appears, teleporting around and slashing them down.</li>
<li>The figure introduces himself to Kaz as <strong>Rain</strong> a mutual friend/associate of Kaz's patron. The imposing armored male shifter gives Kaz a tube-shaped case containing five iron rods engraved with infernal runes. He instructs Kaz to place the rods around a place of battle in the future, and that if he is able to do this task, he will be granted gifts by his patron.</li>
<li>Kaz hesitantly agrees, and the shifter walks away, passing through a summoned portal. Kaz keeps this encounter to himself, trying to hide the rods, but eventually asks Zephyr to identify them. The magic identifies the rods as devices called <em>Dolorconfluviums</em>, but fails to elucidate their function.</li>
<li>Dhamiria and Ova spend the night having dinner at the tavern, and Dhamiria buys Ova some flowers.</li>

<li>On the several days following the departure from Roxton, the team spends time bonding with Ova and Maynard. Zephyr and Kaz talk about magic, and the team deals with the occasional threat from stray Hollows.</li>
<li>One morning, Ser complains that he is feeling weirdly depressed, and happens to spot something suspicious in a cave near camp. The team approachs the cave, but their mounts go into a panic.</li>
<li>Eventually a harsh guttaral voice emenates from the cave, warning them away and insulting the team. Zephyr pulls it from its hiding place with levitation, and it angrily protests.</li>
<li>The creature has a single luminous eye, and appears to be a rare monster known as a Nothic, able to manipulate emotions from afar and extract secrets from people.</li>
<li>After calming it, the team decides to barter secrets with it. Zephyr offers a spellbook, but the Nothic states it cannot read. Zephyr offers that instead, and the Notrick abruptly extracts Zephyr's knowledge of how to read and write in Common from her head.</li>
<li>Zephyr is shocked and horrifed, but it offers this secret in return: "<em>The Lion is gathering massive quantities of adamantite</em>."</li>
<li>Zephyr infers this to be referring to Archmage Thariunne, known as the Lion in the Magipalities.</li>
<li>Leaving the Nothic behind, the team proceeds. Zephyr has to now take notes in Draconic, since she no longer understands written Common.</li>

<li>That morning over breakfast in the tavern, the group agrees they should have a proper name to call themselves. After much deliberation, they agree upon the title of The Graymoore Gang.</li>
<li>Ova suggests to the party to look into the League of Blue Steel as an avenue for earning coin, since the team is in need of more purchasing power.</li>
<li>Before going there, the Gang heads directly to the Crimson Palace, to complete their journey and meet the last Drakelord still living. There, upon showing their badges, they are let in and granted an audience with <strong>Drakelord Djimon</strong>, an middle-aged half-orc man with intimidating red plate armor.</li>
<li>The team shares all their insights with him. He in turn shares his knowledge of the Ox's plans, which likely involve an assault on Drakkengrad in several weeks time. After much deliberation, the Gang agrees with him that they should strike preemptively, stopping the Ox before he can reach the civilians to do whatever terrifying power he has to the innocents.</li>
<li>Beckuss suggests, and the gang agrees, to an assault on <em>Hillfar</em>, where the Ox is currently residing. While he and the other allied Drakelords lead an assault, the Gang will be allowed to sneak in behind enemy lines and deal with the Ox.</li>
<li>He promises the team an advance sum in thanks for their help. They leave the palace and go shopping, purchasing potions and enjoying some downtime before this assault is formally organized.</li>
<li>Dhamiria visits the <em>Sepulchre of the Raven Queen</em>, a large structure dedicated to her goddess. There, she is greeted by the Deaconess, who mistakes her for her <strong>aunt, Barraka</strong>. Confused, and after some discussion, the Deaconess bids Dhamiria to enter into a private chamber and submerge herself in a red pool to seek guidance from the <strong>Raven Queen</strong>.</li>
<li>There she has a vision of the Raven Queen, who tells her that her Aunt is (or will be) in danger, and that the <strong>Coronet of Lloth</strong>, an ancient artifact entrusted to the Kubiri people, is at risk of falling into the hands of evildoers.</li>

<li>Ser visits a shrine to the Nature Goddess, <strong>Melora</strong>, to meditate.</li>
<li>Dhamiria visited the Gavel, the temple to <strong>Kord</strong>, where monks practice hand-to-hand combat. She expresses interest in learning their fighting methods.</li>
<li>Later that day, the team visits the Archives of <strong>Ioun</strong>, a massive library, where Kaz and Zephyr go about trying to relearn how to read and write Common.</li>
<li>Reading also reveals some insights into the history of the realm, as well as recent developments concerning the god <strong>Aegir</strong> (the sea), who has been coming into vogue once again.</li>
<li>The other two ancient titan deities are <strong>Bahamut</strong> (the sky) and <strong>Annam</strong> (the land).</li>
<li>Researching the Velki Enclave, the group finds an account written by a mage named <strong>Gowron</strong>, who describes some of their activities and known history.</li>
<li>Wanting to search the city for any trace of their ruins, as was marked on the map they found in the Windswept Tower in the Darkspires, Kaz and Zephyr fly over the city using Locate Object to find any more pink crystals that match the kind found in the tower.</li>
<li>They find a ping over Landblood Lake beneath the surface, but the guards of Drakkengrad arrest them for flying over the city during wartime. They eventually talk their way out of it, using their influence with the Drakelords, but both Kaz and Zephyr feel rightly abashed.</li>

<li>They ask for the archmage's aid, but he seems unempathetic to their plight. It is only when Ser offers secret knowledge about Thariunne, the Archmage of Lysanor, that he perks up and offers to negotiate. They tell Stroboghast about how the Archmage is collecting adamantite, and he seems puzzled by this.</li>
<li>Stroboghast explains in return the history of the Ox and his lieutenant Vivian. They have been together since before they made their first moves. The Ox also has twin siblings under his guide, also gifted psions.</li>

<li>The morning of reckoning has come. The army moves out to approach the base of the mesas, while the Greymoore Gang branches off on their own to take a different approach.</li>
<li>Kaz, remembering the guidance of Rain, flys off on his own, positioning the Dolorconfluvium around the perimeter of the site of battle in a pentagonal arrangement.</li>
<li>The team questions him, but he is evasive, shrugging off their inquiry.</li>
<li>The army of the Ox runs and flies out to meet the armies of the Midlands, clashing in a horrible chaos of psonic powers and mundane and magical attacks.</li>
<li>The Drakeriders charge into the fray, tossing the Ox's followers left and right.</li>
<li>In the chaos, the team rides into Hillfar from the back side. Once they reach the center, they see him.</li>
<li>The Ox stands atop the central mesa, looking out towards the battle in the distance. Without changing his stance, the team hears him telepathically reach out to them and beckons them to join him on top of the mesa.</li>
<li>Spooked, but knowing it is all they can do, they ride up the central path to the top, and confront the Ox.</li>
<li>Standing at his side is Vivian. She watches the party with hard eyes, having already met them in Roxton.</li>
<li>The Ox tursn to the party. He is a bulky man, wearing a simple fur-lined coat open in the front to reveal a battle-scarred and muscular chest. On his head, he wears the skull of a black drake, covering his face. His eyes gleam from the dark pits of the skull, a brilliant blue.</li>

<li>The team looks back and forth between each other. Ser speaks up, and states that the Ox's means will never justify the end, and the team has come to stop him. The Ox shrugs, and says that the party could have had a place in his world, but they are welcome to choose not to partake in it.</li>
<li>The Ox doesn't move, but the team sees movement from the longhouse behind him. The door opens, and a massive white minotaur steps out, dragging a huge flail. Drakelord Beckuss, not dead but on the side of the Ox, appears.</li>
<li>Vivian lowers herself into a crouch, and the team dives into combat. The true battle for the Midlands had begun.</li>
<li>Ser and Kaz focus on Drakelord Beckuss, who charges at the team. Beckuss is quickly defeated and knocked unconscious.</li>
<li>The Ox and Vivian throw psionic magic at the team, and they begin to throw back and forth spells and counterspells.</li>
<li>As the fight escalates, the team comes under fire from psionic attacks from afar. Eventually, Dhamiria spots one of the Ox's lieutenants hiding in a tipi on another mesa. She shouts out the warning, and the team has to begin to revise their strategy to cope with the distant hiding lieutenants.</li>
<li>At one point, the Ox charms Kaz, and dimension doors across the village to a distant mesa. Vivian and Zephyr face off atop the roof of the longhouse, and Dhamiria rides Mittens off to try to reach the Ox.</li>
<li>Over the next minute, Dhamiria and Ser manage to lock down and finish off Finn, forcing Fayne to flee.</li>
<li>During the battle, both Ser and Kaz are changed by the Ox, who blasts their minds with his power and connects them both to his hivemind. They see in their minds eye all the other followers of the Ox, fighting on the plains nearby.</li>
<li>In the sky over the battle outside Hillfar, the team witnesses a glowing red pentagram form on the underside of the clouds overhead. It pulses with light, before disappearing as quickly as it appeared. Kaz suspects its related to the posts he placed into the ground before the battle.</li>
<li>Vivian is knocked out from her duel with Zephyr, and the Ox rushes to her aid in a rage.</li>
<li>Zephyr manages to blast the Ox as he rushes to help, and in his last moments of consciousness, he pours a healing potion down into Vivian's mouth.</li>
<li>As he dies, Vivian comes back to life, just in time to witness Zephyr standing over the Ox's body.</li>
<li>Vivan screams in horror and rage as the team closes in. Something seems to snap within her, and as the screams intensify, lightning begins to lash out off of her. A violent sphere of lightning begins to grow, like a Tesla coil arcing from Vivian's body to the surrounding terrain.</li>
<li>As the team is about to be engulfed in the horrible surge of magic, it stops as abruptly as it began. A hooded and mysterious figure stands over Vivian, whispering into her ear. She looks shocked and horrified, tears running down her face, gazing at the body of the Ox. The two standing figures disappear as they teleport away.</li>

<li>Drakelord Beckuss survived the battle with the Ox, and as he heals he thanks the team for freeing him from being dominated by the Ox's power. Beckuss and Djimon give the team the remaining two drakehide patches, completing their collection and marking them as heroes to the Midlands.</li>
<li>The team is also paid a hefty gold reward. Ser asks for more, and he is allowed to attempt to bond with an orphaned white drake named Gnasher. Over the next few days, Ser spends hours coaxing and feeding the young drake to form a bond with it.</li>
<li>One night, while the group is sleeping, Zehruut alerts Kaz that the "boss" wants a word with him. Kaz goes to the outskirts of the encampment, and there a voice fills his mind, the same voice her heard long ago speaking to him from a blue flaming fireplace. It thanks him for his efforts, and informs him that the test was a success. As a reward, it gifts him "Ambition." The tattoo on his chest bursts into blue flames, and a hilt of a sword emerges from it. Kaz grips the hilt, drawing out a long, jagged sword forged from blue metal and wreathed in blue flame. The fire dies out, and he returns to the tent, baffled but fixated on this magical weapon.</li>
<li>Victorious, the armies of the Midlands return to Drakkengrad. The party is treated to a heroes' welcome, with the citizens of the city cheering as they return, throwing flowers and watching their triumphant procession. The party is hosted in the Drakelord's Castle, and allowed to partake in all of the foods and enjoy the hot springs.</li>
<li>The party sleeps and rests, content in their victory...</li>

<li>The cavern appears to be a ruined Velki storage depot. Exploring it, they find various loot and notes about its purpose. Using a crystal from the Tower, they power the facility back up, bringing back the lights.</li>
<li>They find a Potion of Self Immolation, which seems to be of dubious usefulness.</li>
<li>In the next room, a pair of stone constructs come to life and attack, defending the room beyond.</li>
<li>They are dispatched with some difficulty due to their magical resilience.</li>
<li>The group uses the strange key they found on the locked door at the end of the hall. Instead of <br> unlocking it, they open a portal to another <br> realm filled with sunlight and grass <br> as far as the eye can see. A <em><strong>Chimera</strong></em> <br> resides there, and it turns all three <br> of its horrible heads to look <br> at them.</li>

<li>They slam the door shut and remove the key, returning it to its inert form. The key is an <em>Arcane Key to Somewhere</em> with one remaining charge, capable of transforming any doorway into a portal to a random location in the multiverse.</li>
<li>After that, they break the door down and smash into the ajoining room. It is a large cavern filled with old crates and boxes, seeming to be a storeroom of sorts.</li>
<li>Inspecting the various boxes, the team discerns that four of the chests are magically locked, and there are four magical keys on a keyring that go to them. A riddle comes attached to the keyring...</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><em>The wood key is two places to the right of the cursed chest.</em></li>
<li><em>The platinum is to the left of the chest that uses the silver key.</em></li>
<li><em>The third chest has either platinum or diamonds.</em></li>
<li><em>The cursed chest is directly to the left of the chest that uses the gold key.</em></li>
<li><em>The gold key is directly to the left of the trapped chest.</em></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>After a good amount of thought, Kaz looks into the chests with his ghost vision and sees the answers, bypassing the riddle and puzzle with ease. Everyone recovers the items they want without being cursed or trapped.</li>
<li>As the group digs through the loot, they are suddenly assaulted by an invisible creature with sharp claws. Using a quick faerie fire, Ser manages to highlight the creature's location, allowing Kaz to slice it to bits with his flaming sword.</li>
<li>After looting every corner of the cavern, and deciding nothing was left of value, the group uses Dimension Door to teleport out of the cave system and back to the surface of the lake.</li>
<li>They return to the League of Blue Steel, and turn in the Wastrilith's teeth to collect the bounty.</li>
<li>That night they go to the agreed upon dinner meeting with the Order of the Grasping Fist.</li>

<li>Seliana is Janos' daughter. Janos reveals that he has an issue with some of his airships being intercepted near Ebrea. Floatstone crystals are getting hard to come by, so he needs his airships back.</li>

<li>The lookout spots land! Ebrea arrives, and the crew prepares for arrival. The kobold is named Ulrich, and Zephyr convinces him to eventually join her on a future crew on her future airship. He agrees and is released back to his tribe in the jungles of Ebrea.</li>
<li>In the distance, the lookout spots a derelict airship, floating adrift in the mountains. The party investigates, and finds evidence of strangle marks on the deck. The cargo, with the exception of the food, is untouched. There are no traces of the crew.</li>
<li>A second airship is spotted floating alone, and the <em>Rapacious Raptor</em> approaches. The team climbs onto its deck, but can't find much going on. Ser casts Detect Thoughts to attempt to find survivors, and instead, detects the thoughts on the ship below him...</li>
<li>The entire vessel is not in fact a ship, but a gargantuan mimic abomination. It spreads its horrible wings, sprouts tentacles from the deck, and takes flight with the team on its back.</li>
<li>Kaz and Dhamiria dive into action, stabbing at its eyes and gaping maw. Dhamiria is snatched by a stray tentacle and flung into its mouth, where she is crunched up in its gnashing molars. She barely cut her way back out into the open air.</li>
<li>Kaz throws a fireball into its mouth, forcing it to close its maw. Ser and Zehruut attack the eyeballs with claws and magic, while Zephyr teleports madly about, trying to avoid being grabbed.</li>
<li>Zephyr jumps off the side and floats to safety on the rocks below, blasting the monster with lightning as she descends.</li>
<li>Ser, going all in, summons a flock of Axebeaks onto the deck which slash and peck at the mimic airship.</li>
<li>As the monstrosity begins to thrash in the air, Dhamiria lands the final blow by plunging her glaive deep into the deck and running along its length, ripping wide a massive slash. The mimic ship lurches towards the ground, and Zephyr catches the rest of the crew with her magic as they leap from its deck and fall gently to the ground.</li>
<li>The mimic airship crashes into the mountainside, and a flock of mephits descend upon its corpse to feed.</li>
<li>Kaz recalls that mimics should never grow that large, and this must be a very rare exception.</li>
<li>Returning to their airship, our heroes continue the search for wrecked airships, predicting that the mimic must have been feeding upon the trade vessels while they sailing through these mountain peaks.</li>
<li>The team found another derelict airship. Cautiously, the crew fires their ballista into the side of it to be sure it wasn't also alive. It wasn't, so the team jumped down to the deck and recovered the remaining cargo.</li>
<li>Zephyr snuck a spell scroll of "Murder of Crows" out of a chest in the ruined ship and scribed it into her spellbook back in her cabin.</li>
<li>A third shipwreck is found wedged between two mountain peaks. The group falls down to its deck from above using feather fall, and investigated. Dhamiria pilfers some <strong>Finder's Goggles</strong>, and the team recovers a sealed chest that seems important to the Grasping Fist. Ser falls from the deck, but Zephyr catches him with more feather fall.</li>

<li>As the Rapacious Raptor departed from the wreck, the deck is attacked by a swarm of Perytons: horrifying bird-beast-elk hybrids. Drawn by the hubbub, mephits descend onto the deck as well to attack the heroes. The captain morphed into his werewolf form, surprising the team, before shouting out orders to repel the attackers.</li>
<li>A minute later, after a lot of magic and Ser polymorphing into a giant ape, the team slayed all the beasts. A Dire Peryton put up a tremendous fight, knocking down Otis and Soliana in the chaos, but was eventually slain by Dhamiria teleporting onto his back and beheading the monster.</li>
<li>Zephyr collaborated with the ship's engineer to preserve the head of the Dire Peryton, and keep it as a trophy. Soliana thanked them all for their indispensable help, and gave them a gold bonus as a reward.</li>

<li>On the fourth day, as the sun lowers to the tops of the mountains, the team finally arrives at <strong>Nyumbani</strong>, the ancestral village in the snowy mountaintops, and home to the <strong>Kubiri</strong> people.</li>
<li>Since the raven was sent ahead, the team is greeted by <strong>Safiri</strong>, Dhamiria's mother. They tearfully reunite, after Dhamiria's months traveling beyond the boundaries of her home where she was raised.</li>
<li>The Kubiri people are generally suspicious of the others, and all outsiders in general. Dhamiria's Uncle, a stout drow named <strong>Uso</strong>, welcomes them in and declares a feast must be held.</li>
<li>The Kubiri warm up towards the team as they enjoy a meal together around a raging bonfire. Dhamiria brings her family up to speed on all the travels her and the team have undergone together.</li>
<li>After the feast, as the party and their mounts are housed and put to rest, Dhamiria goes away with her mother and uncle to talk of more serious matters. She learns that her Aunt, <strong>Barraka</strong>, the leader of their tribe, undergoes a yearly pilgrimage into the mountains to renew a pact with the <strong>Raven Queen</strong> at a spring of red liquid in a cave. This renewall is a vow to reinforce the Kubiri's resolve and emphasize their departure from the evils of the Crawling Queen, <strong>Lolth</strong>, and the Underdark.</li>
<li>The most important act of this ritual is bathing an ancient relic in the red pool, protected by the leader of the Kubiri. This relic is known as <strong>The Coronet of Lolth</strong>.</li>

<li>That evening, in celebration of the changing of the seasons, the Kubiri hold an ice skating race on the frozen lake in the center of the village. Kaz and Ser fail to keep up, but Zephyr and Dhamiria race neck and neck for the finish line (Zephyr abusing every magical advantage she could along the way).</li>
<li>Despite Zephyr's efforts, Dhamiria wins regardless due to her superior skill. Zephyr's efforts do win her some favor with the Kubiri, as they respect her speed on the ice.</li>
<li>Kaz heals a sick child with his magic, and Ser casts plant growth to enrich the crops of the Kubiri through winter. These gestures firmly remove any remaining suspicion of the party amongst the Kubiri people.</li>

Safiri gifts the party two giant goats as mounts, since the horse Borasco and the lizard Snecko are poorly suited for the cold climate and rocky terrain. The animals stay behind in the village.</li>
<li>The party departs Nyumbani, riding on Mittens, Gnasher, and the two goats. They leave the village by way of the open-air burial grounds for the Kubiri.

They near a small valley, and Dhamiria notes the presence of large mole-hill like holes scattered across it. Drawing from her people's folklore, she identifies the region as the lair of a <em>Remorhaz</em>, a deadly burrowing predator known for its scalding hot chitinous plates and ferocious appetite.</li>

There, a small pond sits, where a small waterfall of ruby red viscous liquid pours into the pool from a crack in the wall. In the back far corner of the room, a massive crater drops into a deep black hole, too deep to see the bottom with torches. Unwilling to take any further risks, and needing to heal Kaz's frostbite, the team goes to sleep...</li>

She does, feeling the same surreal loss of sensation as the liquid meets her skin, but it doesn't grant any visions. Instead, she feels a wave of exhaustion, and barely pulls herself back out, feeling horribly drained.</li>
<li>Distracted by her ordeal, Kaz barely notices strange spider-like eel creatures emerging from the large hole in the back of the cave. After a tense moment of confusion, they attack! The party leaps into action, hacking and slashing at a small swarm of the monsters. Kaz is overwhelmed by a bunch of the small ones, while Ser summons some magic goats to stampede them. The largest monster appears to be a spellcaster, and Zephyr finds herself being counterspelled by it. Ser is commanded magically to walk into the ravine, which he does immediately. Zephyr manages to feather fall him as he drops, while Dhamiria finishes off the larger monsters with her glaive.</li>
<li>Zephyr follows Ser down into the ravine, and they investigate its depths. It drops some 800 feet or so, before arriving at a small cave littered with the bones of creatures that fell into it. They find a path that goes deeper underground, with a roughly carved signpost written in Undercommon, which Dhamiria knows. It reads "135 miles to Silh Unarith" and "215 miles to Gaelgaroth."</li>
<li>The monsters are identified as <em>Neogi</em>, evil creatures that wander the Underdark enslaving all beasts they find. Reflecting on what they know and what they overheard from the Neogi leader, the team agrees that Dhamiria's Aunt must have come to perform the ritual but been abducted by a group of Neogi at the last second, pulling her into the Underdark.</li>
<li>Using Fly and Feather Fall, Zephyr and Kaz escort the entire team, mounts and all, down into the ravine. Then, the proceed down into the tunnel, riding for hours into the depths of the Underdark. Eventually the determine it must be close to nighttime, so they make camp and sleep.</li>

<li>Over the following week, the team delves into the Underdark.</li>
<li>They find some odd mushrooms growing on the cave walls and pick them. They have a variety of different effects, from providing light to being a reliable source of bland food.</li>
<li>At one point, the team comes to a 3-pronged fork in the tunnels. Zephyr uses divination magic to decide that the left path is doom, so they take the right path.</li>
<li>The team quickly runs out of food for their animals, so they begin to forage. They find a set of cart tracks in the rock and mud, tracks that match the cart tracks they found leading away from the Raven's Grotto.</li>
<li>Ser eats some mushrooms that, while filling, force him to talk nonstop and have no filter on his thoughts. Everyone finds it thoroughly irritating.</li>
<li>Ser later summons some giant spiders to forage for the team, since they are having a hard time finding food. They are successful, brining back a cave lizard and more mushrooms.</li>
<li>Needing to feed the goats vegetable matter, they give them the remaining edible mushrooms, which also make them bleat like mad for the rest of the day.</li>
<li>Kaz rediscovers the cart tracks, assuring them they are on the right path.</li>
<li>On the sixth day, Dhamiria feels called away from the group by a vision of her ancestors. She follows, and they direct her attention to a large encampment nearby on the shore of large subterranean lake. Zephyr uses <em>Arcane Eye</em> to spy on it from a distance, and they determine it is the home of the Neogi. There are dozens, maybe a hundred or so living there. She also sees several cages filled with captives of different varieties on the edge of the camp.</li>

<li>After planning and resting, the team decides to capture a Neogi for interrogation.</li>
<li>Kaz uses his psionic mind trick to get one away from the camp, while Dhamiria jumps on it. It screams, but Kaz uses Zehruut to distract the guards, and everyone escapes.</li>
<li>Ser uses Detect Thoughts while Dhamiria asks the Neogi questions. They learn that the Neogi sold Dhamiria's aunt to the dark elves living in the capital city of <strong>Gaelgoroth,</strong> about ten days ago.</li>
<li>Learning more about the habits of the Neogi and their wants and needs, the team sends the captive back to his camp to try and barter for the remaining slaves.</li>
<li>After some discussion and intimidation, the Neogi offer to sell the team all their slaves and four weapons in exchange for the <em>Decanter of Endless Water</em> and a huge pile of magically summoned food.</li>
<li>The team feeds and heals the slaves, and gives them a speech to inspire them to help the team attack the Neogi, ending them once and for all. Sixteen of the freed slaves agree to go back and fight.</li>

<li>The following morning, the freed slaves and the gang prepares their plan of attack. They are also joined by a wandering half-orc druid named Kaiju, who wants to contribute and help heal the injured. He met Aunt Barraka briefly, sharing that she momentarily escaped her cage near the Ruins of Silh Unarith, but she was recaptured.</li>
<li>The attack begins in a burst of fire, as Zephyr and Kazbiel rain fireballs down upon the Neogi encampment. In seconds, dozens of their structures burst into flames. The slavers are vulnerable to fire, and many of them rapidly perish. Mittens and Dhamiria dive into the fray, slashing left and right, while Ser uses plant growth to slow and hinder their escape. It is a slaughter, and in less than a minute the entire small village to reduced to ashes. A few survivors flee into the darkness.</li>
<li>The victors loot the camp, collecting a few potions and a couple sets of <em>Haze Goggles</em>, which allow the wearer to see through the strange prismatic haze that is rumored to fill the caverns of some parts of the Underdark.</li>
<li>After departing, Kaiju follows the party and shares some background. He is a member of the League of Blue Steel, and he got lost in the Underdark while hunting strange, corrupted crystalline creatures that have been appearing in the Olmothian Woods. He is also aware of the growing Darkness that Ser fears, and is seeking a solution.</li>
<li>Later that day, the party is ambushed by a hunting pack of Gricks, but they roast them as well with Kaz's fire magic. Food reserves are running low, and everyone is hungry.</li>
<li>The next morning, Kaiju identifies some ripplebark mushrooms for the party to feed on. The party learns of a region in the Underdark known as the Mycellium Wilds, where many of the underdark potions are derived from.</li>

<ul>
<li>The team arrives at <strong>Gaelgaroth</strong>, a massive drow city nestled in a cavern on the edge of the great underground lake.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.gmbinder.com/images/WEQZcqU.png" style="position:absolute;bottom:-20px;left:-20px;width:450px"></p>
<div class="column-break"></div>
<ul>
<li>The group plans their entrance. Knowing the cultural significance of the Drow, Dhamiria pretends to be a slaver, with Kaz as her henchman and the rest as her captives. They climb into the caged wagon they stole from the Neogi camp.</li>
<li>Dhamiria presents herself to the guards of the city, and manages to lie her way past the front gate.</li>
<li>The citizens of Gaelgaroth are exclusively drow, with a heavy female dominance. A few deep dwarves and gnomes are spotted here and there, but noone from the world above. A few of the drow have strange, half-drow, half-fiend servants with 4 arms that vaguely resemble gorillas.</li>
<li>The team parks their wagon in a back alley, and splits up to investigate. Dhamiria and Kaz head to the center of the city, where a large colosseum containing a sand pit sits infront of a carved stone castle. Kaiju transforms into a bat and flys away to scout the area.</li>
<li>Dhamiria and Kaz are granted entry, and rapidly learn that this is a coronation ceremoy. It appears to be a battle to the death, to determine the next Queen of the Underdark.</li>
<li>After a quick and vicious battle of swords and magic, a young drow woman defeats her opponent, beheading the previous Queen. The crowd cheers, and she is crowned <strong>Deepqueen Levray Thenorza, Lady of Gaelgaroth</strong>.</li>
<li>As more gladitorial-style combats ensue as entertainment, Kaz and Dhamiria decide to find out where her Aunt may be and make sure she isn't sent out into the arena.</li>
<li>The team regroups, but Kaiju never returns. They decide to pose as a traveling menagerie, to get close to the guard barracks and investigate where Dhamiria's Aunt may have gone.</li>
<li>Zephyr is put into a dunking booth, while Ser plays music and Kaz provides special effects. Dhamiria leads the show. The performance is so successful, the guard captain asks Dhamiria to perform for the newly appointed Deepqueen. After some tactly investigation, seeking a new member to her traveling circus, Dhamiria learns of another weird drow with tattoos like herself that was recently moved away from Gaelgaroth, to the high security prison of the <strong>Weaver's Perch.</strong></li>
<li>With this new lead, the team leaves the city and moves to the edge of the lake. They lure two drow guards over and ambush them, using some Mind Manipulation magic from Ser to blur their memories of the capture and acquire information about the location of the Weaver's Perch. They trash their slaver's cart and leave the unconscious guards behind, all as cover for getting out of performing for the Deepqueen. One additional guard spots them, but is paralyzed by Zehruut's poison. They bring her with them, repeatedly paralyzing her until the next morning when Ser can mind wipe her as well. The poor guard has a rough night as Zehruut keeps stabbing her to keep her paralyzed.</li>

<li>Overnight, Dhamiria dreams of her ancestors. They guide her, helping her to unlock the remaining potential of her ancestral skill to move within the shadows.</li>
<li>Ser obliterates the remaining memories of the captured guard, and they toss her outside the city and flee.</li>
<li>Wandering back into the maze of the Underdark, the team finally encounters some <em>Havoc Haze.</em> This region of the Underdark is filled with a shimmering, prismatic dim light that is disconcerting.</li>

<li>Those who feel like they need it don the Haze Goggles they acquired from the Neogi Camp and push into the Haze. At first, nothing much happens.</li>
<li>After wandering through it for some time, a gang of Umber Hulks and Hook Horrors attacks the party, forcing them to jump into action. Ser and Zephyr's magic distorts strangely, causing horrible side effects, which hit Kaz instead of their targets. Kaz's goat mount is murdered by a Hook Horror while he is distracted.</li>
<li>Kaz attempts to hit the offending monster with an eldritch blast, but it instead summons an imp next to him, which attacks and knocks him unconscious.</li>
</ul>
<div class="column-break"></div>
<ul>
<li>Dhamiria and Zephyr's summoned monsters finish off the beasts.</li>
<li>Traveling deeper, Ser begins to exhibit signs of Haze Madness, becoming paranoid and seeing things.</li>
<li>At the end of the day, they team pushes on and eventually exits the Haze. Zephyr scouts ahead magically and discovers <strong>Rezbazon, the Weaver's Perch</strong> is very close. It is a large, subterranean prison built into the ceiling of a massive cavern, filling and bridging multiple hanging stalactites. The entire structure is cocooned and swaddled with spider webs, keeping it secret.</li>

<ul>
<li>The party wakes up and begins their plan to rescue Aunt Baraka. The group stealths across the open caven floor, and then uses magic to fly up to the northern edge of the prison and strike hard on a ballista outpost. After overpowering the two guards there, they continue deeper into the complex. Zehruut agrees to be a massive distraction, and takes the Deck of Illusions with him. He starts tossing cards all over the prison, and within moments there are dozens of powerful illusions flying about (dragons, giants, beholders and more). At the entrance to the jail cells, the team takes out the next gaurds with polymorph and a quick punch from Dhamiria. Using the guards' keys, they enter the jail cells. There, they find Aunt Baraka, as well as several other dangerous-looking criminals.</li>
<li>At this moment, the warden of the prison, the <strong>High Weaver</strong>, emerges from her stalactite. With a burst of magic, she dispels the illusions and directs the guards to pursue the true interlopers. Zephyr briefly tries to hit her with some lightning, but it is rapidly countered. Seeing her match, she runs back to the party and urges them all to flee. Kaz tosses up magical darkness, while Zephyr tosses an Air Elemental into the mix. Everyone leaps from the edge of the prison and they feather fall to the cavern floor below.</li>

<ul>
<li>Zehruut flies ahead to bring the mounts over, and the team runs for a different exit tunnel. A ballista bolt from prison behind them comes streaking across the cavern, targeting the weakened Baraka. Kaz, without thinking, flings himself into its path. He is promptly impaled and stapled to the cavern floor, near death. Ser grabs him, and dimension doors them both off of the bolt and towards the mounts. He pours a healing potion into the gaping hole in Kaz's chest, which seems to stop the bleeding but will need further administrations to heal properly.</li>
<li>Zephyr blasts the next ballista bolt out of the air with lightning as it streaks towards the party. With that last deflection, the group escapes into the tunnel, mounts their beasts, and rides away into the distant tunnels. Behind them, up on the cavern ceiling, the Weaver shouts out a promise of capture and vengeance after them as they flee.</li>
<li>As they run, Ser places multiple castings of Plant Growth to overgrow and hinder their pursuers.</li>
<li>The team spends the rest of the day running at random through the Underdark, trying to put as much distance between them and their pursuers. While they go, Aunt Baraka tells her story to them, filling them in on the blanks in her struggles. She was captured before she could complete the ritual with the Coronet by the Neogi. At the ruins of Silh Unarith, she briefly escaped and used the Coronet to become invisible. She threw it into the ruins before the Neogi caught up with her, and she hopes it remains there still. She knew she couldn't let the Drow find it.</li>
<li>With their new destination set, the team begins to seek their way through the Underdark, back towards the region where the ruins reside.</li>

<li>The escapees continue through the Underdark at a breakneck pace, trying to put as <br> much distance behind them. Ser <br> continues to cast Plant Growth to slow <br>their pursuers. After discussing how<br> to escape, they agree to take the <br>shortest path to the Ruins through the <br><em>Silken Paths</em>, a region of the Underdark <br>completely coated in dense, massive spiderwebs.</li>
<li>After arriving, they manage to convince a gnome riding on a spider-like creature to be their guide. He is expensive, and takes several magic items as payment. However, he promises a smooth transit, and they follow his directions to traverse the region.</li>
<li>Despite the initial hesitation, the guide proves invaluable. His food caches and ability to avoid danger is a much-needed respite.</li>
<li>Along the route, they are inconvenienced by more Havoc Haze and Darkmantles, but they persevere.</li>
<li>Talking further, Aunt Baraka informs the team that the Coronet is far too powerful to let it fall into the hands of the Drow. It was known to command armies of undead, summon demons, mind control people, and turn people invisible. It is truly and artifact of pure evil.</li>

At the end of the day, the group finally arrives at a large cavern, where the ruins of Silh Unarith resides.

<li>Descending into the ruins, the party prepares to search for the Coronet. As they inspect the open rocky field where Aunt Baraka recalls leaving it, Mittens sense something stirring above, and growls. The party jumps into action as a massive, worm-like monstrosity flys towards them from the ceiling: a <strong>Neothilid</strong>. Its horrible, eyeless head whips around trying to find them, and in the fight that ensues, it manages to swallow Dhamiria whole. The entire party blasts it with magic, and Dhamiria manages to cut her way out before she is fully digested.</li>
<li>Remarking on its strange size and alien physiology, the group continues deeper into the ruins. Zephy sends an earth elemental named <em>Borborygmus</em> ahead to scout for danger, and it warms them of traps, magical statues, and Driders in different areas of the ruins.</li>

<li>They navigate around most of these obstacles. At one corner of the ruins, Dhamiria finds a statue wearing a <strong>Cloak of Subtlety</strong>, a purple cloak enchanted to provide protection in darkness and conceal the wearer.</li>
<li>Ser and Zephyr decipher the contents of a carved mural, depicting a dragon that attacked the ruins many centuries ago, which the old drow who used to live here call <strong>"Moorvuna the Voiceless One."</strong></li>
<li>Heading deeper into the ruins, following the magical signature of the Coronet, the team arrives at a room filled with glowing purple pools of squirming tadpoles.</li>
<li>They are attacked by three Mind Flayers, and barely escape the encounter. After, Kaz burns all the pools of tadpoles, destroying all chance of these Mind Flayers reproducing.</li>
<li>A the end of this chamber, they find a mucuous-filled tunnel descending deeper, and embedded in the walls of slime, the <em><strong>Coronet</strong></em>. They grab it, and flee the ruins, heading back into the tunnels of the underdark to seek the entrance back at the Raven's Grotto, hoping to escape the tribulations of the Underdark.</li>

<li>Over the next several days, the party moves fast and heals from their troubles. Aunt Baraka expresses her fears about the Coronet, and the team each takes turns carrying it, hidden away, to keep its evil influence suppressed.</li>
<li>The team encounters the occasional Underdark monster, but other than that, travel is quick. Food is sparse and the team is all very tired of eating foraged mushrooms.</li>

<li>Then, unexpectedly, in a region of Haze, the team turns a corner and runs headlong into the <strong>High Weaver</strong>. The Warden had predicted their route, and had taken a different path around the Silken Paths to head them off here, close to the Raven's Grotto.</li>
<li>After demanding the Coronet and Aunt Baraka be turned over, the Weaver attacked the group with her fellow elite guards. A quick and vicious battle later, Dhamiria finished off the dangerous drow with a swift stab of her halberd.</li>
<li>Zephyr takes the Weaver's magic items, including her strange headpiece with spider-like visual elements. The best item she had is the <em>Corset of the Broodmother</em>, a magical corset that sprouts spider-like arms out of silk and grants the wearer the ability to climb on walls.</li>
<li>The team pushes on. Several more days pass, but they eventually arrive back at the bottom of the pit in the Raven's Grotto. With some fly spells, the team levitates themselves out of the pit, arriving back in the cave at the top of the mountain.</li>

<li>The party makes the return trek through the snowy Darkspire peaks towards Nyumbani. After half a week, they arrive back to much rejoicing. After a celebration, Aunt Baraka discusses with Dhamiria's mother and uncle about the fate of the village, and what to do with the Coronet.</li>
<li>The village elders agree the Coronet is no longer safe to be kept in Nyumbani. At Dhamiria's suggestion, they agree to take it to Drakkengrad, where Aunt Baraka will explore options with the Deaconess at the Raven's Wing Sepulchre to find a more permanent, safe solution.</li>
<li>The celebration is short-lived, as the party needs to return to Drakkengrad. The next morning, the team takes their leave of Nyumbani, and starts climbing down out of the mountains to travel to Leafside for teleportation.</li>
<li>They travel through Murkwater, where Ser performs his newly written songs about the Greymoore Gang and their exploits, which are picked up by the locals. On their way across the Timberlands they stop in Xruul, an outpost to watch for invaders to the Midlands.</li>
<li>They find more mossy ruins in the area near Leafside, and find some traces of Ascendant technology. Eventually, they make it back to Leafside, and use the teleportation there to return to Drakkengrad, after a brief discussion with Drakelord Rolar.</li>
<li>At long last, the party returns to Drakkengrad, having completed their Underdark journey...</li>

<li>Having finally returned to Drakkengrad, the party stops to enjoy the sun and catch their breath.</li>
<li>The Deaconess of the Raven's Wing Sepulchre meets with Dhamiria and Aunt Baraka, and they explain the situation in private. She agrees to keep the Coronet safe at her temple, with Aunt Baraka's help. She chooses to stay there, allowing Dhamiria to continue on with her own personal journey.</li>
<li>Kaz visits the Priests of Pelor for their special healing, to finally recover from the painful, lingering injury from being impaled by the ballista bolt in the Underdark. He makes a sizable "charitable" donation to encourage their help.</li>
<li>The party then visits the Wind Trade Union's docks, speaking with an Aarakokra named Klucky Fitzle, who provides them with the control keys to their newly refurbished airship.</li>
<li>The group boards the fixed and sky-worthy vessel, and begins to make plans for how to outfit it. At the bow, the stuffed and preserved head of the Dire Peryton sits mounted. In the front, a meeting room sits beneath the forecastle, and in the back, a room for sleeping and kitchen provide ample room for comfortable traveling.</li>
<li>In the hold, there is plenty of room for the animals, and several bathrooms. The engine room is freshly cleaned and the floatstone core is at maximum charge.</li>
<li>Zephyr is deemed the official captain of the Perilous Peryton, and the group pays several thousand gold to outfit their vessel with all the trappings and conveniences of an adventuring vessel (including two ballista).</li>

<li>After completing their preparations, the Dockmaster hands them a letter from <em>Kelly Seekerton</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>To the Graymoore Gang,</em></p>
<p><em>Word has reached me at my place of study of your daring exploits! I want to congratulate you on your significant contributions to the Midlands at large, and your acquisition of such respect and admiration by the people there. Who would have thought the scrappy band of sellswords would end up achieving such heights?</em></p>
<p><em>It has been several months since we last met, and I wanted to extend an invitation to you all to come visit. My research continues unabated, and our brief time together was instrumental in my investigation. You demonstrated plenty of latent skill for such work then, and have proved beyond a shadow of a doubt to myself and many others your capacity for doing sensitive and difficult work.</em></p>
<p><em>At your convenience, please seek me at my place of residence at the city of Slateway. I promise to serve you a feast befitting heroes. I believe I also have a proposition you may find intriguing, based on our previous conversations; I am certain you are all well-equipped for the tasks I have in mind.</em></p>
<p><em>Respectfully, Your previous employer, fellow researcher and admirer,</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kelley Seekerton</strong></em></p>
<p><em>P.S: If you come, ask for Kelley at the Halls of Antiquity. One of the automatons will direct you as necessary. Also, if you do decide to visit, please do so without drawing too much attention; many eyes watch your movements these days. Being famous does have its downsides.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>With this news in mind, the group heads to the League of Blue Steel to pick up some work to earn money and recoup their expenses.</li>
<li>The previous quest the party had been eyeing is removed, apparently completed by someone else while the gang was off on adventures. The team encounters a half-dow man named <strong>Bradogottir</strong> (<strong>Brad</strong> for short), a badass gunslinger with a katana, and it becomes clear he has begun to complete these quests on his own.</li>
<li>The party takes on the commission for a shapechanging criminal, who has been on a crime spree around Drakkengrad. Some initial investigation reveals they have a fixation on rich people, and seem to be targeting the affluent.</li>
<li>Before that however, the party goes for a celebratory meal in Groztown, sampling the finest Dwarven foodstuffs.</li>
<li>Upon returning the Perilous Peryton that night, the team discovers a ship-warming gift from Duke Janos in the form of a rare bottle of <strong>Liquid Gold</strong> wine from <strong>Pork and Cork</strong> cellars.</li>
<li>Late in the night, the party hears strangers board their ship. Dhamiria confronts them in the dark, and they reveal themselves to be a roguish band of Uryons, robotic citizens of the Uryon Confederation. They have come to the party with a proposition.</li>
</ul>
<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section></div><div class="gmb" id="p41">
<ul>
<li>The warforged band introduces themselves as the <strong>Rustbuckets</strong>, an undercover faction willing to pay the group 8500 gold to help them smuggle a secret package on their new airship to Lysanor.</li>
<li>The leader, <strong>Locke</strong>, hates the Reznor Dominion, and is especially untrusting of Kazbiel. The other Rustbuckets go by <strong>Sledge, Snag, and Scope</strong>.</li>

<li>After lying their way into speaking with the owner, Ser uses Modify Memory to force the owner to divulge his secrets. The owner describes the criminal who traded to crown for "services" as going by the name Mephistopheles, and he lives in the Mudwater Slums on the edge of the city.</li>

<li>He also sometimes visits the Silken Sheets nearby, another brothel. The team heads to that location, and are surprised to see the descibed criminal striding out of the front doors. The group swarms him, trying to subdue him quickly. The man transforms into his true form, a rakshasa, and casts Fireball on himself to try and escape. Zephyr counterspells it. Then, he trys to mind control Dhamiria, but she manages to evade his efforts.</li>
<li>Without warning, the bounty hunter Brad appears on a nearby rooftop, and begins to shoot at the rakshasa, attempting to get in on the action. Kaz throws up Darkness to prevent him from seeing their quarry. Ser traps the fiend with Dhamiria inside a summoned lead dome, and Dhamiria manages to overpower him with brute force, tying him up with magic rope.</li>
<li>Victorious, the team warns off Brad and drags their prize to the League of Blue Steel. There, they seal the fiend into an iron coffin for unknown purposes.</li>

<li>Zephyr's parents, Harry and Breeze, are very welcoming to the group and overjoyed to see their daughter again. Zephyr learns as they dine together in her childhood cottage that the <strong>Unseen</strong>, Lysanor's special agents, have been coming around. Her old mentor, Master Ook-Chin, has gone missing. Zephyr gives her parents a generous cash payment to help them pay off the student loans they took out for her, to ensure the Unseen will stop bothering them.</li>
<li>That night, the group goes to the Clyria College of the Performing Arts, so Ser can participate in an open mic night.</li>
<li>Ser does a great performance, and the listeners are surprised to hear that he belongs to the slightly famous Greymoore Gang, vanquishers of the Ox.</li>
<li>The laster performer of the night is <strong>Libretto the Loquacious</strong>, a talented halfling bard and prior graduate of the college. Ser is impressed by his wordplay and rhythm, and stops him afterwards to discuss at length his methods. They become friends, and the group returns back to the airship to wait.</li>

<li>That morning, Zephyr picks up her parents to give them a sky tour of the city. They are overjoyed to see everything from this vantage point, and are very impressed by Zephyr's successes. They share that Zephyr's old friend <strong>Typhon</strong> recently published a big article about his findings at the Tower on top of the Darkspires. Zephyr was not included in this article, and the Greymoore Gang were mentioned in the acknowledgements.</li>
<li>Annoyed, Zephyr insists upon meeting with Typhon to have a word about proper accreditation.</li>
<li>After returning her parents, the group heads to the Fresh Biscuits Bakery to acquire some snacks and prepare for their secret meeting with Mr. N at noon. They purchase some coffee and snacks.</li>
<li>In the alley behind the building, they find a secret brick button. Pressing it, the wall opens, allowing them to walk down into a secret room. A dwarf sits there, watching suspiciously, and lets them in to meet with Mr. N.</li>
<li>In the following room, there is a small office with a nice desk and various scrolls. A cat with mismatched eyes sits on the desk, dozing. Mr. N appears to be invisible, and speaks to the party from the empty chair. He states that he is the leader of the <strong>Thought Thieves</strong>, a group partially interested in observing and undermining the Unseen in Lysanor.</li>
</ul>

<img src="https://www.gmbinder.com/images/DiqEFtt.png" style="width: 600px;">

<ul>
    <li>Mr. N claims some talent in the psionic arts, and congratulates the party on their defeat of the Ox.</li>
    <li>He remarks on their smuggling efforts, letting the team know that helping the Rustbuckets actually helps the Unseen, and by extension, <strong>Archmage Thariune</strong>. The individual who oversaw the hand-off (Anathema) is his general.</li>
    <li>He informs Zephyr that the Unseen "disappeared" Master Ook-chin, and he asks the group to help him undermine the Unseen directly.</li>
    <li>Dhamiria and Ser begin to prod at Mr. N seeking answers as to why his is invisible, and why is he so secretive. They eventually discern that Mr. N is, in fact, the cat sitting on the table, and not an invisible person. Seeing a bowl in the corner, they infer his true name to be <strong>Mr. Nibbles</strong>.</li>
    <li>Through mutual exchange of information, the team learns that Master Ook-Chin has been deported to work in the archives at the city of Slateway.</li>
    <li>After agreeing to cooperate with Mr. N in the future, the group leaves and heads to visit Typhon's new archeology lab, funded by his discoveries and publications.</li>
    <li>Zephyr has a tense conversation with Typhon, but they hash out a new agreement to not misunderstand each other and to work together on future Velkian investigations</li>
    <li>Typhon, as a gesture of goodwill, pays for a Scroll of Sending so that Zephyr can stay in touch with him in the future.</li>
    <li>Later, ser meets up with Libretto to have a jam session. It goes splendidly, and Ser collects some decent money from appreciative onlookers. Libretto offers to take the group out for dinner, and Zephyr asks to bring her parents.</li>
    <li>Zephyr and the rest of the group purchase fine clothes for the occassion. At dinner, they are introduced to the hobgoblin <strong>Chef Caesar Rocco</strong>, a famous cook and personal friend of Libretto.</li>

<li>The meal is magnificent. After dinner, the Chef and Libretto sneak away to have a private conversation. Dhamiria, being nosy, decides to sneak after them and eavesdrop. She overhears something about some person called <strong>"Hush"</strong> taking flight once again, and the concerning developments with the Unseen. Confused by what she has overheard, Dhamiria returns to the dinner party undetected.</li>
<li>After escorting Zephyr's parents home, the group walks back to their airship. Along they way, they are accosted by a group of unruly, inebriated students. After a short scuffle, where Ser polymorphs the leader and Zephyr slows them with magic, they others continue to escalate the encounter.</li>
<li>Suddenly, from the shadows, a dozen or so hooded and masked figures appear. Their presence immediately calms and quiets the unruly group, and they solemnly scurry off. The Greymoore Gang watches apprehensively, but the figures merely give them a silent stare before retreating to the shadows and disappearing.</li>
<li>Unnerved, the team boards their airship. Feeling paranoid, they investigate the ship for tampering. They find a tracking device mounted to the steering column of the airship, and Dhamiria uses her Finding Goggles to track the location of the creature that placed it.</li>
<li>The team launches the ship and follows her lead, which directs them to a lone figure standing atop the Archmage's Tower. The dim light reveals them to be Anathema, the general of the Unseen. As the figure looks on, the team flys away, tossing the tracking device overboard.</li>
<li>Attempts at divination magic meet a powerful countercharm on the Tower, indicating the Archmage has permanently warded its interior from magical scrying.</li>

<li>The team departs for Slateway, flying in their newly equipped airship. The park their airship outside of town behind some hills.</li>
<li>Upon arrival, they all observe the massive pit that descends into the earth near the edge of Slateway, the opening known as <em>Vexyll's Pit</em>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="column-break"></div>
<ul>
<li>The locals are primarily employed by mining practices into the region around the Pit. Those who unearth valuable relics and artifacts sell them to <em>Archmage Vexyll, the Archmage of Antiquity</em>.</li>
<li>Using some magical coersion, the group lies their way into town and heads to the Halls of Antiquity, seeking out their old friend Kelly Seekerton. The talk to an Automaton called the <strong>Curator</strong>, who takes them to a hidden elevator.</li>
<li>The ride up the elevator takes over five minutes, seemingly traveling a far greater distance than the exterior of the Tower of Inquiry would suggest is possible.</li>
<li>At the top, they enter a spacious room filled with magic relics, statues, fossils, and more. Standing on the opposite side of the room is a woman they don't recognize. She identifies herself as <strong>Archmage Vexyll</strong>, also called, to some of her friends... <strong>Kelly Seekerton</strong>.</li>
<li>The team is shocked to learn that Kelly was an undercover alias for the Archmage herself. She apologizes and explains how she extracted some form of mobile factory from the ruins near Greymoore, using the device she brought with her and with their help.</li>
<li>She explains her knowledge of their fight and victory against the Ox. She then asks them to explore the ancient, dangerous ruins deep alongside Vexyll's Pit, explaining that she suspects more ancient technology like the strange object she brought to Greymoore may reside there.</li>
<li>The group agrees, and sets out down into the pit with Vexyll leading the way. They descend along the wall of the massive hole, and Vexyll explains her theory the pit is a portal to another realm; no one who has ever descended into it has risen back from it again (it likely leads to the Nine Hells).</li>
<li>After arriving at the mouth to a deep cave system near the pit, Vexyll explains she wants the team to find and obtain another Quintessehedron, a power-storing device like the one she had in Greymoore. Her attempts at delving into the Ascendant ruins here have met with danger, so she is enlisting the team to do it for her.</li>

<li>Vexll also reveals that Master Ook-chin does indeed work in her archives, seemingly without coercion.</li>
<li>Ser asks if she has any knowledge about the Darkness in Olmothia, but she is unable to provide further insights. She suggests the Bladewitches may know more, but they are very secretive.</li>
<li>Vexll offers to pay the team 11,000 gold in exchange for an intact Quintessehedron. They agree, but head to the archives first to find Master Ook-chin.</li>

<li>They pause to take a break in a ruined chapel of sorts, containing a shrine to the dead with six small flags. Emblazoned on a plaque, the team reads the following message:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>"Honor the dead, the dying, the lost.</em></p>
<p><em>Honor their deeds with the ferryman's cost.</em></p>
<p><em>Honor, don't gloat, those who have passed,</em></p>
<p><em>with words of peace and pride Amassed"</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The team does their best to appease the riddle, managing to perform a variety of funeral rites and raise the flags partially. As a reward, they find a tomb containing a set of fine elven chainmail, a ring of jumping, and some rare gemstones.</li>
<li>Descending even further, the team stumbles upon a strange, purple and green furred, lupine creature. Zephyr blocks the beast away from the party with a Wall of Force, but another strange beast appears from behind them! Zehruut jumps into action, and surprisingly puts it to sleep right away with his potent poison stinger.</li>
<li>Dhamiria dispatches the sleeping beast, while the party prepares to jump on the other monster. After they are defeated, the team finds the origin of these beasts further down the tunnel: a strange laboratory filled with vats with strange liquid. Once such vat seems to contain something moving, but the team decides to ignore it and continue on their way.</li>
<li>Further down the path the party arrives at a massive door, seemingly sealed with powerful magic. Before it, a series of statues are arranged in a circle, with a strange pattern of images and lines engraved into the floor.</li>
<li>After further study, Ser determines the images depict a ritual dance, to deactivate the magic seal. Ser and Kaz perform the dance, and the doorway unlocks. As they open it, a wave of hot dry air washes over them, and they decide to stop and take a rest outside the gate.</li>
<li>After several hours, their rest is disturbed by a horrific, long-armed monster with too many mouths. It has an anti-magic aura, and rapidly shreds Kaz and Ser's health. Dhamiria attacks it, but barely manages to escape. Zephyr summons the Bagman to drag Kaz to safety, outside the antimagic aura to give him a chance for magical healing.</li>
<li>Ser panics and tries to re-open the seal with a dance, but he messes up the process, causing the statues to spring to life and begin attacking everyone.</li>
<li>In the chaos, the team manages to disrupt the beast's anti-magic aura by breaking its concentration, then it is quickly destroyed with Kaz's magic. Dhamiria starts attacking the remaining statues, and the team stands badly damaged and barely alive. Kaz runs to the circle and completes the dance, which deactivates the remaining statues. They return to their posts, and the party collapses in exhaustion.</li>
<li>Ser casts Tiny Hut, and the team huddles inside to slowly heal and sleep off the pain. The magic barrier reemerges with time, and they dread having to do the dance one more time in the morning.</li>

<li>The players leave behind a large rock, and use it to jam open the magic door. They descend into the heated hallway beyond, and descend into the ruins of <strong>Kalag Dur</strong>. After a long walk, they enter a massive cavern, illuminated dimly from the light of dozens of lava pools. The ruins of hundreds of ancient buildings fills the space, scattered around the lava. They also quickly find petrified statues of people, specifically Ascendants, going about their lives. Scattered between the people, they also find petrified fiends, including a Pit Fiend at one point.</li>
<li>The city was obviously hit with some kind of magical catastrophe. Zephyr suspects that the ancient Blood War of the demons and devils must have spilled over into this city at some point.</li>
<li>Near the center of town, a congregation of statues stand frozen, arranged around a large spherical stone orb. Emeralds are growing out of it. It bears a striking resemblence to the stone orb they found all the way back at the Clattering Keep.</li>
<li>Ser loots some magical powder off of one of the statues, which grants <em>Truesight</em> momentarily. The team uses a pinch, and they all observe that the orb has some powerful, ancient runes on its surface, forming some kind of containment enchantment.</li>
<li>The group heads to the center of the city, where they find a dilapidated building with hundreds of tubes and pipes flowing into it. They enter, and see pools of lava everywhere, and another path going even deeper underground.</li>
<li>As they attempt the cross the hall, they are attacked by a flying Eye Monster who calls himself <strong>Xylagretch</strong>. The abomination cackles and attacks the group, triggering a trap that slams doors down over the entrance and exit.</li>
<li>The team dives into action, gingerly jumping from column to column amidst the boiling lava below. The monster blasts out with a variety of deadly eye-beams and chaotic effects. Ser and Kaz are knocked down by the attacks, and Zephyr and Dhamiria barely manage to defeat the horror and save their friends from a firey death.</li>
<li>Dhamiria takes an amulet of lava walking from its corpse, and the team proceeds onward. Descending into the earth, they enter a massive cavern, where the skeleton of a titan lies amongst lava waterfalls. Magma elementals roam the space, and a mysterious bright red glow emenates from a cave mouth adjacent to the skull of the titan. The team fights past the elementals, and climbs the skeletons towards the cave.</li>
<li>There, they discover a brand new Quintessahedron; this one however, is well over double the size of the one Vexyll brought to Greymoore. It sits in a cradle, obviously siphoning energy from all the magma around them.</li>

<ul>
<li>As they group begins to suffer from the intense heat, Dhamiria charges ahead to grab the Quintessahedron. She rips it out of its cradle, tearing tubes out as she does. Instantly, the facility begins to rupture and crumble around the group, as they realize what they've just done.</li>
<li>The party turns and begins to flee for their lives, carrying the strangely weightless Quintessahedron behind them. They run back through the various chambers of the ruined city, using all their remaining magic and skill to dodge lava flows, falling rocks, collapsing statues and earthquakes.</li>
<li>They burst out into the cooler caves of Vexyll's Pit, but the lava is rising rapidly. With no time to lose, they fly the remainder of the way back up and out of the ruins, bursting out onto the surface, far from the danger below.</li>
<li>They watch as lava begins to pour of the caves far below, falling deep into the bottomless Pit.</li>
<li>The group meets with Vexyll, explaining their journey and turning over the Quintessahedron.</li>
<li>As thanks, Vexyll reveals some information regarding the Darkness in the Olmothian Woods. The Great Alder, at the deepest heart of the forest, has some kind of blight upon it. Her investigation is being stymied by the Alder Conclave, who are not replying to any attempts at communication.</li>
<li>The Bladewitches are similarly unhelpful to Vexyll, so she is limited in what she knows. She suggests the players seek them out and trade with them to learn more. Their base is north of the town of Drollport.</li>
<li>Zephyr heads to the archives and brings a spell scroll of Greater Restoration to fix Master Ook-chin. The enchantment removed, he recalls Zephyr and the events that led to his capture. The Archmage Thariune had him captured by the Unseen and his memories stolen before sending him here to work as a clerk. He had unmasked one of the Unseen, which is serious crime in Lysanor. The unmasked man was seemingly unremarkable, with blonde hair and a beard...</li>

<li>The Mothers are two ancient hags called <strong>Ruth</strong> and <strong>Agnes</strong>. Both of the entities live in the same body, and monstrosity with dozens of tiny feet. The hags promise information about the darkness in exchange for examining Kazbiel's memories of their encounter with the Ox. After agreeing, they greedily study his memories and seem satisfied.</li>
<li>In return for these secrets, they share what they know about the Darkness. It is originating from the heart of the Alder Conclave, from the Great Alder itself. Previously, <strong>Old Silverhands</strong> came through this way seeking answers and traveled deeper into the forest.</li>
<li>The Darkness is associated with strange crystals that grow on the forest and the creatures in it alike. The Mothers do not know its true origin or nature. They offer to the players to consult with the Oracle for a deeper understanding.</li>
<li>Ser agrees to meet with the oracle, since he is desperate for any advantage he can get. In the back of the hut, the Mothers pull back a curtain to reveal a pitch black tunnel. Traveling into it, the team experiences a sense of vertigo and movement that indicates some form of planar travel.</li>
<li>On the other side, they step onto <br> a floating chunk of ruined black <br> stone, where a glowing green <br> lantern filled with swirling <br> light sits on a precipice over <br> a bottomless sea of stars. <br> Zephyr recognizes this space <br> as the <em>Astral Sea</em>.</li>
<li>The group approaches the <br> lantern, and, noticing <br> bloodstains on the rock <br> before it, offers it a <br> blood sacrifice. This <br> seems to awaken a <br> being that resides <br> within the lantern, <br> and it grants visions <br> of a mystical <br> instrument known <br> as the <strong>Tabor of <br> Rhu'Darok</strong>.</li>
<li>It tells the party that <br> this ancient instrument <br> of power may be the only <br> way to combat the <br> <em>Darkness</em>, as it was used in <br> the distant past to do so <br> long, long ago.</li>

<li>Arriving at Oakheart, the team marvels at the small village in the deep woods. All the homes are grown out of the trees and their trunks, and the population is shocked by the arrival of the airship. Ser introduces the gang to his family.</li>
<li>Ser's sister is named <strong>Brassica</strong>, another firbolg. The town is mostly firbolgs, humans, and elves. AFter returning to Ser's childhood home, the team meets her adoptive father, <strong>Elder Hammond</strong>.</li>
<li>He graciously hosts the party and asks them to stay the night, so they can celebrate the coming of the New Year and the last day of the Night Festival with them tomorrow.</li>
<li>The next morning, the team is served a colossal breakfast and they participate in the festivities. There is a drinking contest, an eating contest, a bull elk riding contest, an arm wrestling contest, boulder and log throwing contest, a bar hanging contest, archery, dart throwing, rock throwing into cups, an obstacle course with balance beams and the like, a poetry writing contest, a chess tournament, an open dance floor, a debate forum, and finally the main attraction: a cooperative tree cutting contest, some card games, and a large obstacle course all around Oakheart.</li>
<li>Zephyr loses to Elder Hammond in a game of dragonchess, but she later manages to almost win in the obstacle course. Once again however, Dhamiria's natural ability wins out and she wins the race. Zephyr is awarded an oaken tankard as a consolation prize.</li>
<li>As the festivities continue, they are cut short by horrific, animalistic shrieks from the woods. Two misshappen, crystal-growth covered animals stagger out of the woods and into town. The team fights them back, managing to slay the monsters, but observe their strange magical resistance as a result of their crystal growths.</li>
<li>This shock puts a damper on the festivities, and the party is ended early.</li>

<li>The group meets with Mr. N, and discusses all the issues at hand. Mr. N suspects the Unseen are behind Zephyr's dad's disappearance, but he does note that it is strange he would target her dad specifically.</li>
<li>Mr. N shares that an individual known as <strong>Hush</strong> has begun to disrupt the Unseen's operations at night, and Mr. N wants to speak with him to find out if collaboration is an option. The team agrees to set up a sting operation to lure in Hush in exchange for Mr. N's intel regarding the <em>Tabor of Rhu'Darok</em> and the <em>Darkness</em>.</li>
<li>With Mr. N's input, the team arranges for a meeting with a buyer known only as Miss K. They head to the rendezvous, anticipating that Hush will jump her and steal the item from her to prevent her from trading it with the Unseen.</li>

<li>Hush rapidly attempts to flee, but Zephyr sends the earth elemental after him, grabbing his ankles from the ground. Dhamiria grabs hims as well, but he releases a cloud of invisibility dust on them all and escapes. Ser flies in and uses Truesight powder to find him again, and the chase continues.</li>
<li>Dhamiria uses misty step to catch up to him and restrain him, while Zephyr attacks him with her mind. Kaz appeals to him to calm him down, asking to communicate.</li>
<li>As the chaos calms, the team sees his face clearly, recognizing him as <strong>Chef Caesar Rocco</strong>, the famous cook who knows <strong>Libretto</strong> and previously served them a meal.</li>
<li>Before they can talk, Unseen begin to converge on the location, following the noise. Casting fly, they all flee the area and follow Caesar to one of his safehouses. He eventually agrees to a meetup with Mr. N, stating that their interests overlap regarding the undermining of the Unseen.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Zephyr feels her alarm spell activate, notifying her that someone has stepped onto their airship in their absence. They return quickly, and stalk around nearby to witness the form of <strong>Anathema</strong>, Archmage Thariune's general, leap from the ship and begin walking back towards the tower.</li>
<li>Ser follows nearby, still invisible, and uses detect thoughts to try to peer into Anathema's mind...</li>
<li>As their minds brush against each other, Ser instantly recognizes the thought patterns and color of the entity before them, behind the mask; it is <strong>Vivian</strong>, the right-hand of the Ox who had been teleported away in the final moments of their battle.</li>
<li>A powerful psion herself, Vivian instantly senses Ser's intrusion, and whips around to fire lighting into the air. The team flees before her, running invisibly to Mr. N's hideout. Vivian shoots up a flare for assistance as the group flees. Arriving at Mr. N's hideout, they give him all the intel they have to share about Hush and Vivian, even more info that Kaz is hesitant to share, as Mr. N extracts it with his own psychic abilities.</li>
<li>Mr. N holds up his side of the deal, telling the team about the fabled Tabor, suggesting it was once held in a collector's museum, but then it was stolen by a sneaky red dragon. This dragon is rumored to have also stolen a teleportation circle stone, and Mr. N pulled some strings to acquire its sequence.</li>

<li>After several tense rounds, and a few lucky hits, the group manages to land enough glancing blows on the blur that she stops abruptly and holds up her hands in a truce.</li>
<li>The woman introduces herself as <strong>Porkchop</strong>, one of the legendary members of the Heroes of Harmstead, and old adventuring group that once saved Athendria.

<li>The Gang awakes within Porkchop's castle, in her private estates in a valley filled with grapevines. They speak with her further about their quest to find the location of the legendary <strong>Tabor of Rhu'Darok</strong>.</li>
<li>Porkchop expresses her embarrassment, as she stole it from the collector originally, but she traded it with an acquaintance for some other magical artifacts she wanted. Upon further persuasion, she reveals this acquantiance to be known as <strong>Abdiel Lutair</strong>, a mysterious plane-jumper who once belonged to the same adventureing group as Duke Janos Dragonslayer.</li>
<li>As a final gift as thanks for entertaining her, she sends to Abdiel and requests and audience on their behalf. After a short tour of her vineyards and a chance to feed her pet Griffon, the team is stunned by Abdiel's arrival, in which he steps through a planar rift onto the grass nearby.</li>
<li>Abdiel has orange hair and eyes, with streaks of grey, and nondescript fine black robes. He greets them all, and upon being questioned, informs the party that he took the Tabor as a gift for his friend <strong>Rhu'Darok</strong>, in the realm of Elysium.</li>
<li>After some confusion, the team comes to realize that Rhu'Darok is in fact dead, and Abdiel traveled to Elysium to gift the long-dead bard his favorite instrument from the realm of the living. Abdiel suggests that the team could travel there to ask the bard to borrow it in person, as only Rhu'Darok could gift it to them now.</li>
<li>After a brief conversation, the group agrees to travel with Abdiel to the realm of Elysium, since the Tabor seems to be the only weapon that can possibly stand up against the growing Darkness.</li>
<li>Abdiel agrees to this, and after a brief conversation with Porkchop, Plane Shifts the entire party to Elysium.</li>

<li>The party arrives in a dark, shadowy demiplane. Abdiel explains to them that to actually enter Elysium through these means, they will have to subject themselves to "judgement" by the Watcher. Kaz and Mittens decides to stay behind in the demiplane on this quest, as he in particular doubts that his pact with a devil will help with attempting to pass into the realm of Elysium. Ser, Dhamiria, and Zephyr continue forward with Abdiel.</li>
<li>After a brief jolt, the party finds themselves in a long, seemingly endless gargantuan hallway lined with gigantic columns that rise from floor to ceiling. Clouds cluster around the ceiling, and the floor seems to be an endless highway of pristine, reflective marble. Abdiel is nowhere to be seen. After walking in one direction for some time, Dhamiria spots a distant fast moving object heading towards the party from far away down the hallway.</li>
<li>As it gets closer and resolves, the team beholds the Watcher in all its heavenly and horrific glory. A lion-like beast with four sets of glowing wings, and a head covered in glowing eyes and wrapped in multiple rotating halos, it skids to a stop in front of the party, looming over them with a menacing and overwhelming aura.</li>
<li><strong>The Watcher</strong> asks of them, "Are You Worthy to enter Elysium?" Each party member steps forward, one at a time, and states their intention to meet with Rhu'Darok and return to Athendria to save the Olmothian Woods from the Darkness.</li>
<li>Ser goes first, and after stating his intention with clarity and persuasiveness, the Watcher brings down its massive paw on his head, seemingly crushing him. As the paw lifts, no trace remains. Dhamiria is next, and she attempts to prove her worth with her courage and support of her friend. She too, is dispelled by the Watcher's paw. Zephyr goes last, and builds on her friends' claims, and winces as the paw descends upon her head.</li>

<li>All three of the party find themselves standing in an unearthly beautiful courtyard, surrounding by shifting buildings and gardens. Ghost-like forms wander the space, seemingly in a state of bliss.</li>
<li>Abdiel approaches, the only other solid person to be seen, and congratulates the party on getting past the Watcher. He agrees to take them to Rhu'Darok, and suggests they watch their manners while in the realm, lest the Guardians of the Holy Realm take note of any transgressions.</li>
<li>The group follows Abdiel as he strolls through the celestial streets, and the group struggles to comprehend the shifting, reforming landscape as it adapts around them.</li>
<li>Eventually, the group hears music on the air. A beautiful flute solo is being played perfectly. The group enters a majestic concert hall were hundreds of transluscent shades watch a singular performer play pristine music.</li>
<li>As he finishes his concert, the shades applaud and disperse. Nameless walks the team over to the performer, and introduces them to the spirit of <strong>Rhu'Darok</strong> himself.</li>
<li>The dead Ascendant is friendly enough, but seems distracted and hard to keep his focus. The party asks for his Tabor, but he is unwilling to part with it, as it was his favorite instrument in life. Dhamiria tries to lie about their reasons for wanting it, and the sky darkens as massive angelic guardians appear around the group; lying is not tolerated within Elysium, and the party delicately apologizes to avoid being destroyed.</li>
<li>Ser proposes a musical competition and invents a slapdash instrument with Zephyr's help to trade in exchange for "borrowing" the Tabor. Even though Rhu'Darok crushes them in the competition, his curiousity at their bizzare and haphazard instrument is enough to elict his generosity.</li>
<li>The team is loaned the mystical Tabor as Rhu'Darok summons it from thin air, and they thank him and immediately prepare to leave. Nameless congratulates them on their success, before banishing them all back to Athendria. Kaz and Mittens join the group, and they all return to the familiar location of Drakkengrad.</li>

<li>After the short flight to Lysanor, the team parks their airship some distance away in the grasslands. They wait until the agreed upon time to approach the rendezvous, and then slowly approach the location on the road, their alert on high.</li>
<li>Vivian appears on top of a hill, her helmet removed, with no sign of Zephyr's Dad.</li>
<li>As she slowly descends, she keeps her face a careful mask of emotionless stoicism. As the party stops, and she faces them all down, she announces that she has come to make them pay for how they hurt her, and how they murdered her father.</li>
<li>Ser and Zephyr try to reason with her, but she is unreachable. She states that the only way justice can be found, for them to pay for how they killed the Ox, is to make them feel the same loss.</li>
<li>Her demeanor of calm shatters, and she throws herself in a fury at the party. As they dive into action, they plead and reason with her to try and talk her down, but it isn't enough. A violent fight ensues.</li>
<li>Ser is hit with one of Vivian's strongest spells: feeblemind. Ser is rendered useless, and it looks unlikely that everyone will escape intact. However, in the last critical moments, Zephyr manages to blast Vivian down, knocking her unconcious.</li>
<li>As Vivian falls, her suit activates a contingency, surrounding her body in a forcecage. As the team heals up and tries to figure out what to do, suddenly there is a flash as <strong>Archmage Thariune</strong> himself teleports nearby. He surrounds the party, flanked by a half-dozen of his Unseen troops.</li>
<li>He dispels the forcecage and lifts Vivian, healing her before addressing the party. As she comes to, he slowly turns his attention to the group and tells them that Vivian is not to be harmed. As a peace offering, he removes the feeblemind curse on Ser.</li>
<li>Vivian feebly attempts to protest and express her anger, but Thariune swiftly stops her with a firm and dangerous glance. He tells her to return Zephyr's father, and to be done with this petty revenge ploy.</li>
<li>Vivian slowly opens a <em>Portable Hole,</em> and Harry, Zephyr's father crawls out. He is unharmed, but somewhat neglected. He mostly seems confused.</li>
<li>Thariune turns back to the <br> party and tells them that the  <br> matter is settled. They  <br> are banned from entering <br> Lysanor, and must keep <br> their distance from Vivian. <br> He then turns to Vivian, <br> and they seem to engage <br> in some form of psychic <br> communication. She intially <br> seems to resist, but then bows <br> her head in supplication. <br> Thariune, Vivian, and the <br> Unseen teleport away, back to <br> the city, leaving the party <br> with Harry and a <br> free <em>Portable <br> Hole</em> in the <br> grasslands <br> outside <br> Lysanor.</li>

Multiple of the villagers are beginning to show signs of crystal growths, and some claim to be able to hear a distant ominous singing.</li>

<h3 id="prologue-ser-and-zephyr-27th-of-nimbus-8-months-6-days">27th of Nimbus (8 Months, 6 Days):</h3>
<ul>
<li>After resting, Ser and Zephyr head into the darkened part of the Olmothian Deepwoods, seeking the Alder Conclave to seek a solution to the Darkness, and to leverage to power of the Tabor if possible.</li>
<li>Large, unnatural mushrooms and crystalline growths have sprouted everywhere. Ser speaks with a squirrel that has a partially crystal body, and convinces it to help guide their path. The forest begins to shimmer and display aspects of havoc haze all around, so the team puts on their havoc haze goggles and forges onward.</li>
<li>Ser takes to playing the tabor, which seems to keep the oppressive darkness and havoc haze at bay. After wandering for what seems like a day or longer, the squirrel beckons them onward, having arrived at the deepest part of the woods.</li>
<li>They enter a clearing, where a small outdoor market sits vacant. A large shrine at the far end of the clearing sits between them and the Great Alder, a gargantuan tree beyond the clearing.</li>
<li>As lightning flashes overhead, they notice that the villagers are both present and not present; they are only visible, walking about in the flashing of the light. Otherwise, the space seems to be deserted. It is all deeply ominous.</li>
<li>Suddenly, they are attacked by dark fey creatures, and they fight their way out of it with difficulty. Proceeding past the Shrine to Melora, they head towards the base of the <strong>Great Alder</strong>.</li>
<li>Approaching the base, everything begins to be formed fully from crystal. The trees and rocks are all fully transmuted, and it begins to be evident that there is some sort of crystal growth or explosion, frozen in space, originating from the base of the tree.</li>

<ul>
<li>They are assaulted by a shadowfell monster, which Ser manages to polymorph the beast and dimension door it into the sky. It falls to its demise, and they approach the origin of the Darkness.</li>
<li>Here, the humming is loud and omnipresent; a dark an unsettling tune that digs into the mind. Ser's gentle drum beat on the Tabor is all that keeps it at bay. At the heart of it all, they find a large clear crystal, within which they can make out the form of multiple humanoid figures standing in a circle, in the midst of casting some kind of spell.</li>
<li>Nearby, they see Old Silverhands frozen in crystal, reaching his hands towards the center of the circle. Sensing this living crystal as the source of the Darkness, and ready to take action, Ser raises the Tabor and strikes a powerful beat to banish its influence. With a pulse of light and sound, a sonic wave cracks the crystal, and it begins to crumble. The humming falters and stops, and all around them the crystalline growths begin to disintegrate.</li>
<li>As the crystal collapses into sand, so too do the trapped figures inside the heart of the structure. Seen clearly, it is a circle of druids who had all been holding hands in a magic circle. Chief among them, an earth genasi druid leaning on a resplendent wooden staff, turns to Zephyr and Ser and asks, "What have you done?"</li>
<li>In that moment, the entire clearing trembles. The ground cracks, and the tiled floor churns into chaos, falling into an opening hole. In the darkness of the hole, a brilliant glowing pink eye opens and looks out.</li>
<li>The psionic song begins anew, but this time with words in Draconic, with a might and intensity that overwhelms the senses. The Druids flee, stumbling, and Ser and Zephry fly up and away from the choas.</li>
<li>Rising from the rubble, uncoiling from the earth, a gargantuan Dragon with crystalline pink glittering scales emerges. Its long flowing serpentine body uncoils from the valley, leaving a chasm in its wake. It floats into the sky, roaring its psionic song of awakening as it does. It is at least 1500 ft long, or more.</li>
<li>The clouds part overhead as the dragon ascends into the sky, singing its triumph as it leaves. It drifts away into the distant horizon, leaving behind a scene of crumbled stone, ruined earth, and a mighty valley where its body had rested.</li>
<li>In that moment of emergence, ancient, primal knowledge floods Athrendria. Some ancient magic broken, every sentient being becomes aware: <strong>Atrexalon, God of the Gemstone Dragons</strong>, has returned.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.gmbinder.com/images/bAbphCr.png" style="position:absolute;bottom:-50px;left:-20px;width:450px"></p>
<div class="column-break"></div>
<ul>
<li>Ser and Zephyr regroup with the druids near town, where the townsfolk have dropped out of etherealness and are looking around in bewilderment. The earth genasi druid introduces herself as <strong>Lady Spinel</strong>, and explains what has just occurred.</li>
<li>The Alder Conclave of the Olmothian Woods became aware that there was an entity beneath the Great Alder many months ago. The humming and subtle earthquakes alerted them to its presence. Spinel, along with her friend the wizard Gowron of Lutetia, arrived to attempt to determine what it was. No amount of their powerful magic could reveal what it was, its name, its intention, or otherwise. Fearing what it could be, the druids agreed to a sealing ritual, led by Spinel and Gowron, to keep the entity from waking up.</li>
<li>What occurred instead was a failure, and all it did was delay the awakening. The power of Atrexalon is inevitable, and the druid ritual became corrupted by his potent draconic magic, transforming into living crystal and corrupting the Olmothian woods with the <em>Darkness</em>.</li>
<li>With Ser's Tabor, he banished the Darkness, but in doing so also allowed Atrexalon to fully awaken. With his escape, the third Dragon God of the triad, previously unknowable, has returned to wander Athendria and wreck untold havoc.</li>

<ul>
<li>Meanwhile, Kazbiel, Dhamiria and the newly awakened Mittens attempt to teleport to <em>Kellenora</em>, Kaz's home and the ancestral holy city of the Reznor.</li>
<li>The teleport unfortunately goes awry, and the group finds themselves fighting off a demonic hyena deep in sweltering jungle. After defeating the beast, they attempted the teleport again, this time achieving the correct destination.</li>
<li>There, Dhamriria pretends to be a noblewoman from Yvat'Los, and potential fiancee to Kaz. They are escorted from the teleportation circle across town to the Hall of Emergence, where Kaz's mother, <strong>Duchess Olonida Daetoris</strong>, holds court. A beautiful and intimidating tall drown noblewoman, she strides across the hall to inspect her bastard son and his bride-to-be.</li>
<li>After some tense and awkward words, she invites them to dinner to talk more informally.</li>
<li>They return to Kaz's childhood home, a mansion overlooking the drow city. At dinner, Dhamiria meets Kaz's two siblings, Indra and Yuminar Daetoris. They adopt different attitudes towards Kaz, with Yuminar being stiff and formal, while Indra is insulting and casual.</li>
<li>The dinner is tense, with lots of discussion. The Duchess reveals she wishes for Kaz to become an ambassador for Kellenora, due to his success out in the world against the Ox, and earning a reputation for himself.</li>
<li>After dinner, Kaz and Dhamiria wander the gardens and confront Indra, who becomes especially nasty towards Kaz.</li>

<li>She tells Kaz he is unworthy, and she will never acknowledge him. If she has the chance, she will gladly cut him down for being a traitor. She leaves in a huff.</li>
<li>Kaz and Dhamiria accompany the Duchess to the armory, where she gifts Dhamiria a <strong>Siphon Glaive</strong> as a wedding gift.</li>
<li>The Duchess speaks with Kaz alone in his room, gifting him the outfit of a Reznor Ambassador. Kaz is defensive and confronts her, and she reveals in annoyance that she is also a Warlock of the Fiend, but she would never get caught. She chastizes Kazbiel for his ignorance and naivety, and offers him the job one last time.</li>
<li>Kaz turns her down, and she leaves the chambers in disgust.</li>
<li>After Dhamiria and Kaz confer in private, they hear footsteps approaching. Not trusting the hospitality of his mother, they both flee the room through the window, and retrieve Mittens from the stables.</li>
<li>Moments later they are spotted by the would-be-assassins who had come to their rooms to kill them, and alarm bells start ringing.</li>
<li>The two rapidly flee the mansion grounds, and Kaz makes good use of the <em>Mislead</em> spell to distract and confuse the pursuing assassins.</li>
<li>The two flee into the lower city, now seeking the blacksmithy where Dhamiria learned her father may be in disguise.</li>
<li>After talking to some locals and various checks, they find the simple blacksmithy, and run into a stout drow man leaving at that moment. Confronting him and revealing her tattoos, Dhamiria is reunited with her father, who beckons them inside.</li>
<li>Her father, <strong>Amani</strong>, explains how he was been watching the Reznor for years in secret, and a recent traveling blacksmith who knew about the Kubiri came to sell her wares, which peaked the interest of the Duchess. Sensing the Kubiri may be in danger, he sent the raven messenger to Aunt Baraka as a warning and a request for rescue. He is overwhelmed to be rescued by his daughter, who has grown so big.</li>

<p>16th of Durak
We arrive in Ebria to collect our kobold crew. As we fly in, the kobolds scramble amongst their treetop village. Something is amiss.... HOLY SHIT ANOTHER DRAGON!</p>
<p>An amethyst dragon busts out of a cave and threatens the Precious Peryton.</p>
<p>16th of Durak
Amethyst Dragon Assault</p>
<p>The dragon is resistant to psychic damage, it uses a gravitational breath to obliterate us and anchor us to the ship. Fortunately, Dhamiria is an angel of death and our combined lightning bolts and the like are able to finally shoot it down, Ser delivering the final blast of green lightning. As it perishes, its body disintegrates into atomization and completely disappears, unlike the differentiate spell I can cast however.</p>
<p>We land at the kobold colony and collect our crew, they are totally impressed with us and immediately acquiesce to our requests. As we acclimate the kobolds to their new duties, we head to Crystallia where we have business with Kaz' possible father and also Garvin, we want to get cool tattoos. We end up heading to the peak of the Apheru pyramid to discuss Kaz' situation. It also sounds like the Beta Rho Omega chapter might have some knowledge of special dragon armor crafting techniques.</p>
<p>We confront a certain Chadwick about his business dealings with Kazbiel's mom. Ser uses his mind magic to convince Chadwick to reveal that his youngest brother, Larry, was very close with Duchess Olomeda.</p>
<p>He also offers to pay us 3600 gold to ship some smuggled goods to Yvatlos. We all then go to Garvin's Inks and get badass magical tattoos. I choose a lightning absorbing tattoo that is a stylized woman holding lightning bolt in the air, a la Lady Thor.</p>
<p>Ser goes SUPER deep into debt in order to get a draconic transformation tattoo. Dude is cray cray.</p>
<p>20th of Dumak
We are a little behind with meeting typhon in Aeracrest. We decide to head out as soon as possible to make up for our issues.</p>
<p>During the trip I scry upon Larry Ravionne (Kaz's presumptive father) in order to determine what he is up to and if we can find him. He appears to be working an adventure for the CCC along with the gnome we met in Leafside, Voros, and a tortle we do not know. During my scrying it becomes clear that Larry is somewhat passive. They appear to be in the heart of a dense humid jungle. A scrying on Vivian fails to take affect as she appears to be magically protected against such observation at the time of my casting.</p>
<p>21st of Dumak
I scry upon Vivian, it is successful during the middle of the day. She is shaking down the headmaster of the university of Allure in Lysanor. I relate this to Mr. N through Sending and we set forth a timeline to arrive there to help his rebellion around the 21st of Isoldre. I also observe her having feelings at the top of the tower of the archmage. We will have to craft a clever sending to reach out to her in a diplomatic manner. This could be a very touchy and sensitive subject to breach with her but I feel it must be done. I collect the braintrust to decide on a path forward. Meanwhile, Kaz convenes with Zehrrut to get a better grasp on what he is doing with the Blue Duke and what the plan is on their warlock pact.</p>
<p>We convene to send a message to Vivian, it manages to get through and she responds favorably, unfortunately further communication seems to be unlikely because of the archmage's influence.</p>
<p>2nd of Isoldre
We arrive in the Isles of Gravitas. They are intricately tied together though some of the rocks have fallen into the sea. Aeracrest has a set of 3 airships from the research expedition tethered to a “dock”. An aarakokra comes to greet us. He is imposing and has a terrifying maul. In any case he allows us to visit and warns us to not run over any young aarakokra. Cracklebeak Swifthammer is his name. He presents us a docking form which I will have to fill out. Aeracrest is clearly a bureaucratic nightmare however.</p>
<p>Aeracrest seems to be having rocks falling into the sea for the last 4 to 5 months. It seem that changes have been occurring ever since the velkian enclave noticed an atmospherical anomaly.</p>
<p>It appears that Typhon's theories on the reason the floatstone is sinking is due to some malpurpose by the king. He may be actively hiding something from us, or he is dead and that is being hidden, etc.</p>
<p>We decide to 'celebrate' our research experience as cover to discuss our plans where the Unseen can not hear.</p>
<p>3rd of Isoldre
Typhon distracts the unseen while we investigate the outskirts to see if there is something out there that will inform us on the nature of Aeracrest's issues. Ser notices a house that is hanging out on an underhang on one of the floating islands.</p>
<p>Some wyverns and a chimera come busting in, random monster attack!</p>
<p>The wyverns descend upon us! It is a terrible decision for them. Kaz summons a crown of blue stars and obliterates the chimera. I haste Dhamiria and she flies up to engage the wyverns, finishing off the chimera as she goes. The wyverns assault Kaz and paralyze him with their poison, it is the last thing they do. I differentiate one to dust, and Ser thunderblasts the other two right into Dhamiria's whirling spear. It's over in no time.</p>
<p>The owlin hiding inside the floating house greets us timidly. Cadbert Farsee is grateful for our help and he reveals that he was one of the king's scientists in the floatstone mines, and he ran away from the events that occurred there. Ser brews him some tea and now he is on our side. Apparently some construct dogs assaulted there science team while the king was visiting. That was about 5 days ago which doesn't line up with the loss of floatstone but it does explain possibly why the king has been unavailable.</p>
<p>Ser and Kaz apply their best charms to convince Cadbert to help us get access to the king's mines. He agrees to help us by using his credentials to get us in.</p>
<p>We return to Aeracrest with Cadbert in tow. He uses his status to get us access to the castle, along the way, we notice a very popular blacksmith that appears to possibly sell floatstone based weaponry!</p>
<p>The first group of guards hardly blinks at Cadbert and us. Our path takes us through the throne room however and these guards are much more suspicious. It does not stop our silver tongued duo however! Unfortunately, ahead of us the guard captain, one who is quite intelligent and cunning, still await us. Ser simply tells him how it is and he lets us through. Huh. That was easy.</p>
<p>We leave Cadbert in an introductory hallway and I summon Borborygmus to keep us company. The first few rooms are mining equipment, forges, etc. One room appears to have a bizarre floor inlay with an intricate key based structure. Ser fashions a key with his creation ability and activates one of 3 cubic kilns. A green glow fills the room from that cube. In one room we find a lot of float stone and a crystal golem assaults us. It is handled in short order by Ser using a hold monster spell. Borborygmus is jealous of the coolness that was the crystal golem.</p>
<p>As we continue to explore the labyrinth, Dhamiria falls through the floor as it collapses beneath her, Kaz chases her down as they fall to the sea below the Aeracrest island. In a dramatic turn they barely survive the fall and are able to dodge a giant snapping dragon turtle in the ocean below. They return via flight, and as they are resting, Ser has an experience with Nivrag the debt collector appearing in his mind. We continue to explore, there is a teleportation circle as well as some of the king's private rooms.</p>
<p>We continue on and are ambushed by some construct snakes!</p>
<p>Construct Centipedes slither down the hall, we are in tight quarters, but the Greymoore Gang is unafraid of these contraptions. Dhamiria hacks them apart, it appears that Ser is temporarily poisoned by one and confusedly assaults Dhamiria to no effect. After shaking it off he polymorphs one of them to a slug. We win. Investigation of the mechanical snakes shows us nothing about how they function. The next room contains an underground waterway that trickles away into the sky beneath, the upstream passage appears to be traversable. Another room with a green box setup is here. We continue as we don't have the key. A hall full of shrapnel traps bloodies the party, but we press on and find a fountain room. The fountain here appears to be very similar to the one we discovered in Kelly Seekerton's dig site. The puzzle asks for schools of magic which we apply, necromancy, illusion, and divination magic. A mobius strip of platinum is here. It is another Ascendant relic of spells and magical utility, a spellbook!</p>
<p>The Atlas of Endless Horizons.</p>
<p>SO COOOL!!!</p>
<p>I now must decide which spellbooks to attune to!</p>
<p>Kaz and Ser combine their ghostly gaze and creation to craft another key to the second cubic keyslot. Kaz sends Zehruut down the river tunnel where he discovers another cave with a mechancial dog! It launches mechanical harpoons at Zehruut and slaughters him, we await it at the mouth of the river and prepare ourselves to slaughter it. It rushes out and Ser holds the monster allowing us to bombard its paralyzed form.</p>
<p>A cursory inspection of the defeated construct reveals it has ancient Ascendant power source (now drained) and other ascendant script upon it. We move through the dungeon, and through an irising door is a massive brass dog construct. It roars a thunderous shout that stuns most of the party, fortunately I am able to trap it inside a wall of hardened air. When Kaz comes to, he casts sickening radiance on it and the creature succumbs, impotent. We proceed, and are ambushed by a harpoon dog! I convert it to slug form using my wand and kaz and Dhamiria slaughter its mechanical snake companion. Two corpses of royal guards are laid out here. I find a collapsible rod (magical!). The next room contains some shadows of scorched aarakocra. Totally annihilated. Small tubes protrude from the ceiling. Looks like a trap! I carefully spider crawl my way along the wall with the slug in tow. Once past, I drop the slug into the hole in the floor and eliminate it. Returning to the party, we go through another door and its full of nasty fungus. Further progress reveals another room full of floatstone, another crystal golem resides here! A casting of my murderous mists in conjunction with Ser forcing the opponent back into the winds restrains and crushes the golem. A satisfying victory. Later, we barely resist the power of a terrifying charming ascendant statue.</p>
<p>4th of Isoldre
Finally, we clear the dungeon and activate the third room. Returning to the room of glowing statues, the hatch in the floor opens and slides aside revealing a spiral staircase into the floor with glowing light emanating from below. Inside is a quintessahedron glowing blue and emanating crackling lightning. 3 Aarakocra sit huddled in this room as well as some dead ones. They have been down here for nearly a week and some have died including the king. Dhamiria and Kaz help the Aarakocra return to the throne room while Ser and I investigate the quintessahedron. I contact Vexyll and send her a sigil sequence to the teleportation circle so she can directly aid us in stabilizing the hedron.</p>
<p>It appears that the quintessahedrons are each attuned to a different element. The one we retrieved from Vexyll's Pit is a fire elemental hedron this one appears to be from the Plane of Air. It will be difficult to recharge this hedron... Perhaps Stjarnaheim or something in the plane of air will provide us with a recharging power.</p>
<p>We discuss how we will handle this situation, keeping Thariune in the dark and also helping Typhon with his research project. It is a sticky situation, with some very sensitive knowledge. But we make a great plan.</p>
<p>We tell Typhon the islands are falling through natural decay, that floatstone is a finite resource. We will keep the Aarakocra secret about their quintessahedron and reveal all of the information that we can about its function. We settle our business in Aeracrest and retire to our airship, successful.</p>
<p>That night, Kaz is summoned by his patron...</p>
<p>After Aeracrest
Kaz is visited by a devil. Demiurge. This charismatic individual offers us a job to recover an Iron Jar from a dao on the elemental earth plane. We agree to this offer in exchange for information, communication and a great sum of gold. Demiurge agrees to meet us the next day to begin our adventure. I designate the Perilous Peryton as our location of recall using the Atlas of Endless Horizons. We orient the kobolds and Mittens to pilot the airship to Drakengrad while we are gone.</p>
<p>7th of Isoldre
Demiurge arrives early the next day and immediately plane shifts us to the earth plane where we are immediately almost run down by a oxen team and carriage. It is very dark here, possibly because we are underground. Some light seems to emanate from greenish mushrooms growing on the sides of buildings and walls. Ser asks the first local we see where we can go to find stuff and he is directed to the Almanac, a directional monolith that gives some directions. This town is called the Ceaseless Delve. Ser cons some locals into telling him where the Collector hangs out. Heading out of town, I prepare Locate Creature so that we can detect him when we get close. We head toward the lava pits, that were suggested to be in the direction of the Collector's home. At the first magma pit we are waylaid by magma bulettes! Demiurge is immune to fire and handles it easily. Rayne goes invisible and murders stuff from safety. Dhamiria slaughters the bulettes. We win handily. The heat of the lava pits wears on us, but we continue on. I cast a locate creature spell and we find the Collector without too much further ado. He greets us at the top of a hill. He is clearly reluctant to part with his jars however. In the end, he agrees to give away a jar in exchange for a “training bout”. We head to an arena and face off against a squad of jar contained entities. The first squad is two gelatinous cubes and a frost giant, yeeks. We slaughter them. The dao releases his second assault, a Nightwalker oozes forth. It is a shadowy beast of huge proportions. I funnel my whirlwind into its space and it becomes a darkness twister. Unfortunately, the third assault is a Pit Fiend, a truly terrible beast that is resistant to magic, extremely powerful, and capable of terrifying magic. Through extreme effort we are barely able to emerge triumphant. The Collector is impressed and offers up an Iron Jar to Demiurge as compensation for his entertainment. Our contract is complete.</p>
<p>8th of Isoldre
It becomes clear that our schedule isn't going to allow us to fly all the way to Lysanor in time for the revolution. We decide that we will be teleporting to the magipalities and having the kobolds fly the ship behind us. First we are going to stop in Drakengrad because Ser has some business to deal with there. The kobolds intend to have a party of some kind in the meantime as well. They claim that they will be celebrating their monthly birthday! I decide to purchase a large pig to bring to the celebrations.</p>
<p>Ser and Kaz combine their wealth to pay off Ser's loan to the Choice Cuts Corporation (CCC). Ser discovers as he is paying that he was pickpocketed along the way to the CCC from the palace and lost some 150 gold as well. I purchase a Web scroll while in town.</p>
<p>Dhamiria and I head to the Raven's Wing Sepulchre to visit with her kin. After discussing our travels, Dhamiria asks about the enchanted spear glaive she received from Kazbiel's mother. The priestess tells her that it is likely cursed with some kind of divination magic, that may be allowing the Duchess to spy upon us. As we are discussing stuff with the priestess, a Kubiri guard sneaks into the back chambers with Dhamiria's glaive and attempts to steal the spider queen crown. She was apparently mind controlled while holding the glaive!</p>
<p>As we discuss the enchantment on the glaive it becomes clear that Duchess Daetoris may have been watching us this whole time and knows everything we do. What a monster! We are alerted via sending that Nyumbani is being marched upon by an armed force! We rush to defend the town and the priestess of the sepulchre sends us to Nyumbani!</p>
<p>We rush our preparations, picking out a ravine in the snow where we can pull down an avalanche on the invaders. I send out an arcane eye to observe their approach. Both Kaz's brother and sister are leading a column of drow warriors and even drow abominations, draegloths.</p>
<p>Kaz confronts his siblings in the ravine of ice, he makes his appeal mostly to his brother, and his sister clearly doesn't want to talk. Indra commands an attack, Yumenar hesitates.</p>
<p>Indra screams and charges across the ravine at Kaz's illusory self, as she does so, Ser unleashes a thunderwave that causes an avalanche. It buries the drow warriors in snow and eradicates them. The draegloths struggle out of the snow. Tourbillion engages them, Dhamiria engages them. Indra places Ser in a hamster ball otilukes sphere. Kaz faces off against Indra in mortal combat. Unfortunately, Indra chants a code phrase and Dhamiria's glaive takes over her mind! Dhamiria turns on us, cutting down Ser in moments. We are scrambling, Kaz attacks Dhamiria and thundersteps Ser away from the conflict. Dhamiria is rattled out of the charm, and Ser is teleported to safety. Kaz engages again, and Tourbillion holds the attention of the draegloths. I disintegrate one and revive , Dhamiria slays two more, and Ser is able to stun Indra. As we continue the onslaught, Yumenar comes rushing over the ridge and leaps to save his sister. It's getting hectic when finally, Ser polymorphs Indra into a slug. Dhamiria finishes off the last Draegloth and combat comes to a close. Kaz and Dhamiria find themselves discussing the fate of Indra and the reasons we were fighting each other. When Kaz reveals that Duchess Daetoris is a warlock, making pacts with demons, Yumenar is shocked.</p>
<p>There is much deliberation. There are no easy answers, and murdering Indra in cold-blood doesn't seem like the best choice. Ultimately, we decide to have Yumenar turn in his sister to the Shade Queen. I call upon my agreement with Demiurge and acquire the teleportation sigil to Shelthalas. After a short break, we bring Kaz's siblings and a beheaded draegloth to Shelthalas via teleportation circle.</p>
