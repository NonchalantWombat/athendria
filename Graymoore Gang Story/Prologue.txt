# Prologue

### Date: the 2nd of Isoldre in the Year 1127:
### Location: the coastal trade city of Seabend:

***Vivian** walked alongside her companion, glancing around the central thoroughfare of Seabend. She took in sights and smells of the bustling traders, artisans, snake oil sellers, and other travelers in the dense port city. She was reminded of her earliest memory, a faint recollection of seeing the sparkling waters of the Vanjan Sea, smelling the fishy air and strange spices of the trade quarter, all while clinging to the Matron's hand.*

*Recalling the Matron Mother, she then reflected on her years growing up on the outskirts of Seabend, and the various abuses she suffered under the old crone's command. Despite her upbringing being sponsored by charitable donations from wealthy benefactors in distant lands, she and the other orphans labored and begged to earn their shelter, while the Matron Mother squandered the funds on darkgrass and vodka for herself.*

*These memories of her youth stirred the familiar churning rage within her. Her years of begging on the streets of Seabend, as well as the difficult transition when she had begun to attract the unwanted gazes of sailors and passerby, the jeers from Matron at her growing mottled patches of skin, and the constant hunger as a growing teenager had all shaped her into a hardened youth. She left Seabend after her tenure at the orphanage ended and wandered the northern coasts of the Midlands. She begged, slept in stables, and accepted any work wherever she could find it.*

*Vivian had kept the rage bottled up, tightly wound like a coiled spring. She felt it grow with every passing week, sprouting like a gnarled weed from the rocky soil of her unhappy life. One night, while cleaning an empty tavern after hours, the last patrons shuffled out, jeering at her as they went. She felt the rage bloom, billowing outwards, filling her with terrible purpose. As she reached out to everything around her in rage and despair, wanting nothing other than to wipe it all away, her Master stepped into the room. He found her in that empty tavern, and in him, she sensed a kindred spirit immediately. He understood her, on a level no other ever had, and he held her steady with his wisdom and boundless strength. Taking her away from all the horrible people, he transformed her hatred, sharpening it into a vision for the future.*

*Returning to the present, Vivian saw her destination come into view. The public house of the Magistrate loomed ahead, and she prepared herself again for the speech she had practiced. Moments later, after she had entered the bustling public space filled with guards and loudly declared her demands for the Magistrate to swear fealty to her Master and join her in their shared vision for a better world, there was a deafening silence. The bustling townsfolk stopped and craned their necks to see the diminutive young woman, and her looming hooded partner standing behind her.*

*The Magistrate stood up in his chair at the far end of hall, peering at Vivian. He sneered briefly, and told her to get out of the space, as she was obstructing people's work. She repeated herself, stating that this was the last chance for the people of Seabend to make amends for their failures and debasements, and to join together under the banner of her Master. The Magistrate laughed, and waved for the guards to remove them from the space.*

*Vivian felt her anger flaring up, but then she heard her Master whisper to her, in the way that only she could hear. He comforted her, and reminded her to begin the meditation exercises he had taught her. Vivian closed her eyes and focused on the feeling of her own heartbeat, willing it to slow and quiet. Her Master stepped forward, looming between her and the guards. His large presence sheltered her from the judging eyes all around. As he unfolded himself outwards onto the guards, the Magistrate, and all the citizens of Seabend, she continued to count her heartbeats. The screaming began, rolling and echoing around her, the cries of all the people who had wronged her. She strove to not let it distract her focus, and she continued to count heartbeats with determination. She reached a count of 453 before she noticed that all was quiet once more. She opened her eyes, and looked upon her Master again. He turned to her and smiled his reassurance, and together they looked towards the vision of the future she had sworn to make real with his help. She reached out towards the people of Seabend, seeking those who would join them, and making note of all those who could not...*
