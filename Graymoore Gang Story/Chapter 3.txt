# Chapter 3 - Arkalon

### 18th of Ahwa:

* At the end of the 7th day, the group finally arrived at **Arkalon**. They found the girl's parents and returned her to them, and then headed to the center of town to report the local Drakelord, **Shasa**.
* After rolling into **Arkalon** at dusk, the team took note of the rustic setting. Huts and thatched houses lie scattered across the swampy terrain.
* Well-equipped hobgoblins roam everywhere, some riding on black drakes. The black drakes are more squat and lizard-like, with low curling horns.
* At the Drakkeep, **Drakelord Shasa** greeted them in a mead-hall like entry room. She is small, but imposing in her black armor and face mask covering her acid-burned face. She wields a heavy warhammer.
* After telling Shasa about the cultists on the road, she dispatched a squad of her warriors to "deal" with them. She thanks the group for their escort, and pays them.
* After some doubt, she asks Kaz for help with interrogating a Reznor spy they captured, as it will be one way he can demonstrate his loyalty and that he is not a threat to Arkalon.
* After leaving, Zephyr had a surprise encounter with **Typhon**, her old hobgoblin schoolmate from Lysanor. He was excited to see her, explaining that he was visiting family in Arkalon, and planning on making an expedition to the Darkspire Mountains soon to follow a lead he had on some ancient ruins.
* Zephyr agreed to help, once they leave town.

### 19th of Ahwa through the 24th of Ahwa:

* After visiting the various stores, the group learns more about Moorbounder preferences and what they like. Dhamiria got better at controlling Mittens.
* The team went spelunking in a nearby cave to collect rare mushrooms for a magic user known as **Mistress Ebony**, who studied under *Archmage Stroboghast* in Calcimony.
* After that, they explore a dense thicket populated with Displacer Beasts. They slayed the monsters, and brought back a couple of hides to Mistress Ebony. She trades them a displacer cloak, which Zephyr wears.
* Having earned some spending money, the group stocks up on supplies. Ser and Kaz trained with the Hobgoblins in the morning.

### 25th of Ahwa through the 26th of Ahwa:

* The trip to the ruins in the Darkspires was 3 days away, followed by a long climb. The team prepared and purchased cold weather gear.
* That night, Drakelord Shasa approached the group incognito, and thanked them for helping out around town. She shared shocking news, that the city of *Hillfar*, home of the white drakes, had fallen to the might of the **Ox**. **Drakelord Beckuss**, the minotaur leader there, was presumed dead.
* Also concerning, was that *Drakelord Tyre*, the leader of the city of *Roxton*, home of the green drakes, had stopped responding to communication.
* Shasa was concerned he may be entertaining thoughts of betrayal. She asked the team to investigate on her behalf in Roxton, and to try to prevent any further incursion from the **Ox**.
* She gave the group a sending stone, a tool for communication with her in the future. She also gave them black drakehide patches, to match their blue ones, as a gesture of her approval.
* Her last gift was a pouch containing 500 platinum, as "persuasive collateral" should Drakelord Tyre need additional persuasion.

## **LEVEL UP (6)**

### 27th of Ahwa through the 1st of Silvara:

* The group left Arkalon, hiring an escort to guard the mounts and care for them while they made the climb. They traveled with Typhon, and bought a giant riding lizard named Snecko for Kaz. 
* The short trip was mostly uneventful, save for a few attacks from will-o-wisps in the swamps.
* On the third day, the group met a tabaxi monk named Brightclaw, a member of the Order of Brotherhood. He played music with Ser, and the group relaxed.

### 2nd of Silvara:

* Arriving at the foothills, the team left their mounts behind and walked into the base of the Darkspires.
* The team had to scale multiple dangerous cliffs, cross ravines, and climb ropes to make the steep ascent.

### 3rd of Silvara:

* Waking to an icy morning, the team pushed on. An icy lake and razor-sharp rock fields presented further challenges, but they persevered. 
* At one point, a yeti threw rocks at them before dashing away into the falling ice and snow.
* They eventually reached the mountaintop, and saw a small, frozen tower sitting inertly. A sign over the doorway labeled the ruins as "Outpost 213."
* Entering, they were attacked again by the Yeti, which had made the tower its home. A short and brutal battle ensued, where the team managed to scare it into the basement with fire magic, but not before it blasted them all with its horrible ice breath. The cold was so immense, everyone but Typhon, who was sheltering behind Dhamiria, fell unconcious.
* They woke again, healed by Typhon and made a fire to keep warm.
* Not wanting to give the beast a chance to recover, they descended into the basement of the tower to finish it off.
* After succeeding, they took their rest in Ser's safe magic Tiny Hut, nursing Snecko back to health from his near brush with death from the cold (lizards don't do well in the ice and snow).

### 4th of Silvara:

* After waking, the team explored the tower. Starting in the basement, they found a dusty laboratory with some kind of cage containing the bones of a long-dead dragon-like creature. Kaz harvested some yeti fur from the corpse, and Zephyr inspected an old pile of crystals.
* Using a machine like a treadmill, Kaz charged up a few of the empty crystals, making them glow pinkish.
* Using these crystals, the team was able to power the ruins, giving light to the scene.
* On the main floor, Ser summoned a pile of meat to placate some trapped ice wolves in an adjacent room, which likely belonged to the Yeti.
* He found stashed in another side room some magic goggles, as well as a strange device labeled as *The Potionator.*
* On the top floor of the tower, a massive telescopic appartatus began to spin after powering the floor with a crystal.
* A display flickered on, taking measurements before displaying data about weather around the entire planet of Athendria. It took special note of three regions, highlighting them with the following text:
    * *The Isles of Gravitaas*
    * *Southwest of Ikesh, in the middle of the ocean (labeled ???)*
    * *NorthWest of Ikesh and slowly moving (labeled Stjarnaheim)*
* The outpost was last online in the year 597 PC.
* After that, the group spent the rest of the day extensively researching the ancient books on the walls, trying to learn more. They found a map of the location of other outposts across the Midlands, as well as notes on the Sundering, and ancient cataclysm that changed the face of the planet.
* They learned about Stjarnaheim, the ancestral home of the Cloud Giants, who are known to be very hostile to outsiders.

### 5th of Silvara:

* After packing up to leave, a strange dwarf wearing a fur coat and silver gauntlets appeared, introducing himself as Eoras. He joins the party, seemingly fascinated with their travel methods and foods.
* The descent is faster than the climb, but still challenging.

### 6th of Silvara:
* The team ate a steaming pile of bacon that Ser summoned, which Eoras took part in with gusto. He told the group a story in exchange. 
* After some conversation, it turned out to be **Old Silverhands**, the legendary dwarf wanderer that is hailed by the silverfaced dwarves that the group had helped on the road to Leafside some weeks past.
* Later on during the descent, Dhamiria was struck by horrific bad luck and had a boulder land on and crush her leg, causing a permanent injury. 
* Eventually the team arrived back at the mountain's base, reuniting with their animals and mounts. Typhon lost a couple toes to frostbike, and Dhamiria's leg healed poorly. The group continues on the road towards Roxton, their mountain adventure complete. Typhon parted ways with the group, returning to Arkalon to process his findings.

### 7th of Silvara through the 8th of Silvara:
* Continuing east towards Roxton, the group avoided trouble. They saw a wild pack of Moorbounders, but evaded them
* On the first day of the Summer Solstice, the group encountered an elven man smoking a spectacular pipe.
* He introduced himself as Ranvig, a traveling magic tattoo artist. Dhamiria received a tattoo of Mittens to match her others, while Ser got a cluster of forest animals and Kaz got a magic circle around the strange brand mark on his chest.
* Zephyr bought a scroll of Absorb Elements off of Ranvig instead of a tattoo.
* Arriving at Roxton, the group was harassed by unpleasant roadside ruffians, but Ser managed to talk his way out of conflict. They team walked into the small city, noting the large fort at the center, and the clustered buildings and shady people all around it. That night, the rested at the local tavern in Roxton.
