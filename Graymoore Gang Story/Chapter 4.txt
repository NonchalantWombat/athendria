# Chapter 4 - Roxton

### 9th of Silvara:
* The next morning, the group returned to the entrance of the fighting ring and paid for entry, descending into the **Proving Pit**.
* The Rules of the Proving Pit: No magic, no weapons, and the last one standing wins. Each day there is a cash prize for the winner of 200 gold.
* As the team watched, it became obvious that most participants were cheating in subtle ways. 
* Dhamiria added herself to the roster, and entered the ring against a halfling man named Mudfeet the Swift. She dominated the first fight.
* After a short rest, her second opponent was **Thickjaw Widefist**, the massive goliath bouncer who had let them in earlier that day. Ser utilized a wide variety of vocal tricks to distract Thickjaw, and Dhamiria made quick work of him.
* Ser applied some medical ministrations to Dhamiria, getting her back into fighting shape. 
* Her third opponent, **Ripfang the Eager**, was a tough fight. The gnoll came out clawing and biting, and kept Dhamiria on her toes, but she punched back, hard.
* In the championship round, a mysterious contender known as **Ova** arrived, late to the bout. After they removed their helmet and entered the ring, Ova was revealed to be a half-orc woman of considerable strength. Dhamiria was immediately smitten, but didn't let that affect her focus.
* The following fistfight was prolonged, with both Dhamiria and Ova resorting to sneaky magic tactics to get through. Dhamiria barely eked out a victory, and as the crowd cheered, she helped Ova up. Ova wiped off the blood and asked if they would be available for dinner.
* The team gathered their winnings and left, crossing Roxton to stay at the Dirty Elf Tavern, locally famous for its complimentary defenestrations.
* The tavern owner throws a few people through a large stained glass window, which immediately heals itself.
* Over dinner, Ova explains she is a knight of the *Order of the Gilded Rose*, from the city-state of Bulghraz. She is on the lookout for her friend **Sir Maynard the Mighty**, a bare-chested dwarf with a curved horn helmet who missed their rendezvous with Dame Ova.
* Additionally, Ova suggests that Drakelord Tyre of Roxton has been in discussions with emissaries of the Ox.

### 10th of Silvara:
* The Festival of Warmth is ongoing, so the the team decides to visit the nearby refugee camp with Ova and speak with some of the poor folk. There, they meet a necromancer performing healing on the refugees named **Bloodrinker Painbringer Slaughterkiller the Fourth** (BSPF for short). He is trying to establish a flower shop nearby, and encourages the team to come visit for the festival.
* Ser trudges around healing refugees from the Laudron and Hillfar disasters. A couple of the refugees, named **Glint** and **Balfor**, discuss their experiences with the Ox and his crew in Laudron. Ser does his best to help out and the refugees clearly appreciate the effort.
* The group visited a dubious resale shop and purchaes some quality (and likely stolen) clothes from a goblin tailor.
* Afterwards, the team went to the central fort to seek an audience with **Drakelord Tyre**. After speaking with them, they learned that the Drakelord was contemplating who to support, and would decide based on who resolved their issues with the local gangs by removing the gang leaders. 
* The leader of the *Acid Fangs* gang is **Nubtail**, a tabaxi that uses drake venom and hangs out in a warehouse in *Backstab Alley*. We could sneak in with a transport of special caviar or we could bribe some of his guys to get a face to face. The leader of the* Green Scales* gang is apparently named **Karyl,** and she has ties with the underground drake racing ring.
* At the tavern, the team met with some *Bladewitches* that were working with BSPF to help heal and interrogate the refugees. They gave Ser some ingredients to synthesize some rare poison, and instructions on how to brew it, after the group told them all they knew of happenings in the area and lore about the ruins in the Darkspires.
* Ser and Zephyr decided to mix the poison in their room at the inn.
* Dhamiria and Kaz tromped over to the emerald garrison to get more info on the caviar shipment. They successfully acquired the rights to be the guards for the entry into town. They then visited *Floral Laurels* to buy some flowers from BSPF.
* That evening at dinner, we ran into Ova and discussed visiting the gang lords tomorrow to help her find her friend. Dhamiria begins to make efforts at flirting with the paladin.
* Kaz volunteers to let Dhamiria hang out with Ova all night while the others handle the poisoning effort. Fortunately, (or unfortunately?) they had a nice evening, but Dhamiria was able to rejoin the group before they left to monitor the road.
* The first wagon comes down the road, a heavily armored wagon covered in spikes. It is driven by an older gentleman. We do a thorough inspection and discover no caviar.
* A second cart comes down the road, this one outfitted with the same large pointy spikes as well and with two drivers. After some investigation, the team identified the caviar compartment and slyly poisoned it with the poison using Ser's animated rock. Then the team bailed and spend the night at the inn.

### 11th of Silvara:

* The next morning, the team goes to inform Drakelord Tyre that they had successfully poisoned Nubtail's caviar. Tyre thanked them and commanded their guards to begin infiltrating Backstab Alley. As the team left, they ran into the envoys of the Ox, who were just arriving to also speak with Tyre. Kaz sent in Zehruut to spy on the meeting.
* The leader appears to be a young drow woman named **Vivian**. She declares that they had dealt with the threat posed by Karyl. As the envoys left, the team confronted them. Zephyr insulted Vivian on her vitiligo skin condition, and Vivian forced her to experience some of the suffering she had endured as a child and teenager because of it through a spontaneous psychic connection. 
* Moments later, Kaz rashly decides to jump into action, diving into combat and grabbing Vivian, flying her up to a great height in an attempt to drop her. This ends very poorly; Vivian flys away from him with ease, then blasts him with a powerful lightning bolt. Kaz falls and barely survives. After a very tense moment facing down the envoys in the streets, Vivian defuses the situation before walking away, encouraging the team to join the Ox, as they have potential for passing his test.
* Kaz is dragged back to inn to recuperate. Ova heals him, and she also uses her magic to fix the lingering injury to Dhamiria's leg from their climbing accident back in the Darkspires.
* After recouperating for a few hours, the group heads out to help Ova seek her friend in Backstab Alley. There, they are confronted by a thug who claims that Nubtail has perished from a bad case of the tummy-aches. He demands the group hand over their cash, and Kaz promptly assaults him, triggering a huge rush of thugs to charge into the fray. 
* Everyone defends themselves, and Ser summons a bunch of wild horses out of nowhere that crowd the alley. The thug leader summons a hailstorm, but Kaz manages to force half of them to flee with the Mace of Terror he was loaned by Tyre.
* After the encounter, the team takes the bandit leader captive and interrogates him. He leads them to a warehouse where Maynard is being kept as a bargaining tool. Heavily armed dragonborn confront them, but Ser manages to calm one of them while the rest evade the other. Dhamiria sees some thugs running down a side alley with a wriggling sack, and chases them down on Mittens.
* The thugs turn over Maynard, who is furious at his treatment, but grateful to the team and Ova for rescuing him. As the group leaves Backstab Alley, chaos ensues around them as Drakelord Tyre's gang moves in and begins to exert control over the leaderless gangs.
* That night, everyone gets to know Maynard, another of the Knights of the Gilded Rose. To celebrate, everyone visits the Butter Churn to try their famous green butter, which induces an unpleasant hallucinogenic state.
* Ova and Dhamiria sleep on the floor to let it wear off, and wake up rather close. It is awkward, but in a good way.

### 12th of Silvara:

* The morning is spent in training, before the group seeks out the Drake races to try their hand at gambling. Ser cheats quite a bit to boost one of the racers, and the team manages to win some gold.
* Zephyr spots one of the thugs that reports to Karoyl, and the team follows him to her hideout beneath the racing track. There, despite being surrounded, they attempt to bargain with Karoyl.
* After much impassioned debate, everyone manages to convince Karoyl to leave Roxton with her followers, as opposed to siding with Vivian and waiting for Tyre to be overthrown. Vivian appears to be working both sides, promising success to each if they support the Ox. cutting through these lies helped Karoyl see that there is very little chance of success if she stays.
* Returning to Tyre, the group relayed their success. Tyre is confused, but them figures out that they were lied to with a false vision by the Ox.
* Tyre is pissed, but thanks the team for removing their rivals and bringing to light this deception. They agree to support the other Drakelords in their fight against the Ox.
* As thanks, Drakelord Tyre gifts the team a young green drake named Schnuffles, as well as another Drakehide patch to add to their collection. Having won the support of three Drakelords, the team sends message of their success to Drakelord Shasa, and prepares to leave Roxton.

### 13th of Silvara:

* The team spends the day training some more, visiting BSPF's flower collection, and Dhamiria pays a rogue to teach her how to better move stealthily.
* Kaz receives a strange message from Zehruut, telling him to meet an "associate" outside of town that night. He goes out on his own, and on the road outside town he is attacked by a group of Hollows. After a moment of panic, an armored figure appears, teleporting around and slashing them down.
* The figure introduces himself to Kaz as **Rain** a mutual friend/associate of Kaz's patron. The imposing armored male shifter gives Kaz a tube-shaped case containing five iron rods engraved with infernal runes. He instructs Kaz to place the rods around a place of battle in the future, and that if he is able to do this task, he will be granted gifts by his patron.
* Kaz hesitantly agrees, and the shifter walks away, passing through a summoned portal. Kaz keeps this encounter to himself, trying to hide the rods, but eventually asks Zephyr to identify them. The magic identifies the rods as devices called *Dolorconfluviums*, but fails to elucidate their function.
* Dhamiria and Ova spend the night having dinner at the tavern, and Dhamiria buys Ova some flowers.

### 14th of Silvara:

* Before leaving, they visit the local buisnesses. Ser manages to haggle for a *Deck of Illusions.*
* The team gathers their things and heads out from Roxton. They take the northern road towards Drakkengrad, bringing along with them Ova and Maynard.
* The first day is easy going, and everyone is happy to be out in the open again, away from the dense streets of Roxton.

### 15 of Silvara through the 19th of Silvara:

* On the several days following the departure from Roxton, the team spends time bonding with Ova and Maynard. Zephyr and Kaz talk about magic, and the team deals with the occasional threat from stray Hollows.
* One morning, Ser complains that he is feeling weirdly depressed, and happens to spot something suspicious in a cave near camp. The team approachs the cave, but their mounts go into a panic.
* Eventually a harsh guttaral voice emenates from the cave, warning them away and insulting the team. Zephyr pulls it from its hiding place with levitation, and it angrily protests.
* The creature has a single luminous eye, and appears to be a rare monster known as a Nothic, able to manipulate emotions from afar and extract secrets from people.
* After calming it, the team decides to barter secrets with it. Zephyr offers a spellbook, but the Nothic states it cannot read. Zephyr offers that instead, and the Notrick abruptly extracts Zephyr's knowledge of how to read and write in Common from her head.
* Zephyr is shocked and horrifed, but it offers this secret in return: "*The Lion is gathering massive quantities of adamantite*."
* Zephyr infers this to be referring to Archmage Thariunne, known as the Lion in the Magipalities.
* Leaving the Nothic behind, the team proceeds. Zephyr has to now take notes in Draconic, since she no longer understands written Common.

### 20th of Silvara through the 24th of Silvara:

* The team travels onward along the dusty roads towards Drakkengrad. Zephyr struggles each day, and Kaz begins to try to reteach her how to read.
* In a small ravine, the group is attacked by a large hoard of Hollows, including minotaur Hollows and a Hill Giant Hollow. It is a bloodbath, but the group emerged victorious.
* On the 24th, the team rides along a tributary of the Crooked Claw River. Coming over a hill, they see a massive city in the distance. 
* This bustling metropolis stretches across the Tawny Hills, and dozens of airships float lazily over the rooftops. A massive red keep dominates the skyline to the north, and thousands of city folk wander within the heavy outer walls. Ships in the Landblood Lake harbor fly flags from many nations.
* The group has finally arrived at the heart of the Midlands, and home to the Red Drakes, ***Drakkengrad***.
* The party is halted by Red Drake Riders at the eastern gate to Drakkengrad. They are interrogated by a psionic mage, who checks to see if they are tainted or controlled by the Ox. They are let in.
* The bustling metropolis surges around them as they wander, and Dhamiria gets promptly pickpocketed by an elderly woman.
* Spending some time in the Pentapark, they take in the polished natural beauty, with its symmetry representing the five cities of the Midlands.
* Zephyr stops to admire the airships docking at the towers of the Wind Trade Union.
* That night the team rests at the Drunken Drake Tavern in the Night District, paying much more than they're comfortable with for lodging.
