# Chapter 5 - Drakkengrad

### 25th of Silvara: 
* That morning over breakfast in the tavern, the group agrees they should have a proper name to call themselves. After much deliberation, they agree upon the title of The Graymoore Gang.
* Ova suggests to the party to look into the League of Blue Steel as an avenue for earning coin, since the team is in need of more purchasing power.
* Before going there, the Gang heads directly to the Crimson Palace, to complete their journey and meet the last Drakelord still living. There, upon showing their badges, they are let in and granted an audience with **Drakelord Djimon**, an middle-aged half-orc man with intimidating red plate armor.
* The team shares all their insights with him. He in turn shares his knowledge of the Ox's plans, which likely involve an assault on Drakkengrad in several weeks time. After much deliberation, the Gang agrees with him that they should strike preemptively, stopping the Ox before he can reach the civilians to do whatever terrifying power he has to the innocents.
* Beckuss suggests, and the gang agrees, to an assault on *Hillfar*, where the Ox is currently residing. While he and the other allied Drakelords lead an assault, the Gang will be allowed to sneak in behind enemy lines and deal with the Ox.
* He promises the team an advance sum in thanks for their help. They leave the palace and go shopping, purchasing potions and enjoying some downtime before this assault is formally organized.
* Dhamiria visits the *Sepulchre of the Raven Queen*, a large structure dedicated to her goddess. There, she is greeted by the Deaconess, who mistakes her for her **aunt, Barraka**. Confused, and after some discussion, the Deaconess bids Dhamiria to enter into a private chamber and submerge herself in a red pool to seek guidance from the **Raven Queen**.
* There she has a vision of the Raven Queen, who tells her that her Aunt is (or will be) in danger, and that the **Coronet of Lloth**, an ancient artifact entrusted to the Kubiri people, is at risk of falling into the hands of evildoers.
* Disturbed, Dhamiria leaves the Sepulchre and informs the team of her desire to visit her home soon.
* Ser visits a shrine to the Nature Goddess, **Melora**, to meditate.
* Dhamiria visited the Gavel, the temple to **Kord**, where monks practice hand-to-hand combat. She expresses interest in learning their fighting methods.
* Later that day, the team visits the Archives of **Ioun**, a massive library, where Kaz and Zephyr go about trying to relearn how to read and write Common. 
* Reading also reveals some insights into the history of the realm, as well as recent developments concerning the god **Aegir** (the sea), who has been coming into vogue once again.
* The other two ancient titan deities are **Bahamut** (the sky) and **Annam** (the land).
* Researching the Velki Enclave, the group finds an account written by a mage named **Gowron**, who describes some of their activities and known history.
* Wanting to search the city for any trace of their ruins, as was marked on the map they found in the Windswept Tower in the Darkspires, Kaz and Zephyr fly over the city using Locate Object to find any more pink crystals that match the kind found in the tower.
* They find a ping over Landblood Lake beneath the surface, but the guards of Drakkengrad arrest them for flying over the city during wartime. They eventually talk their way out of it, using their influence with the Drakelords, but both Kaz and Zephyr feel rightly abashed.

### 26th of Silvara:

* The next day, Dhamiria returns to the Gavel for training, Zephyr joins a children's reading class with Kaz's help, and Ser reads about alchemy from the potionbook he got from the Bladewitches in Roxton.
* Ser also goes around purchasing supplies from the local potionmakers.
* Zephyr walks to the shore of the lake, using Arcane Eye to scout beneath the waves. The investigation is unfruitful.
* The team returns tot he Crimson Keep to have their appointed meeting with Drakelord Djimon, and to meet virtually with the **Archmage of Cultivation, Stroboghast (the Goat).**
* They ask for the archmage's aid, but he seems unempathetic to their plight. It is only when Ser offers secret knowledge about Thariunne, the Archmage of Lysanor, that he perks up and offers to negotiate. They tell Stroboghast about how the Archmage is collecting adamantite, and he seems puzzled by this.
* Stroboghast explains in return the history of the Ox and his lieutenant Vivian. They have been together since before they made their first moves. The Ox also has twin siblings under his guide, also gifted psions.
* Finn and Fayne are their names, and they specialize in mind tricks and abjuration psionics.
* Zephyr asks for a scoll of Intellect Fortress from the Drakelord before the team leaves.
* The team goes to the Legue of Blue steel to sell some of their stuff, including the old dragon bones and rotting yeti hide. They also accept a quest for finding and slaying some trolls in the badlands near the city.
* Zephyr scribes many of the spell scrolls she has collected, while Dhamiria and Ova go out on a dinner date in Drakengrad. On the date, Dhamiria encounters the old woman who stole her amuelt, and scares her into giving it back.

### 27th of Silvara:

* The team leaves Drakkengrad to seek out the Troll den. After a few hours of traveling away from the city along the river, they find the caves. There they are beset by three different trolls, the biggest of which is a Dire Troll with 5 arms and 3 heads. 
* The battle is fierce, and Dhamiria is nearly eaten alive. She survives thanks to Ser's healing magic, but gains a few impressive scars from the experience.
* The group returns to Drakkengrad and is paid a handsome bounty for the trolls.

### 28th of Silvara:

* The following day, the team takes time to begin strategizing for what is to come. They know a reckoning with the Ox is imminent, so they go shopping to prepare. They use their advance pay and bounty from the trolls to fund the purchase of several potions, while Zephyr transcribes all the spells from spell scrolls painfully slow with her returning literacy.

### 1st of Sevana through the 7th of Sevana:

* Over the course of the next week, the Drakelords muster their forces in Drakkengrad. All four of the allied Drakelords appear with their armies and Drakeriders. 
* In a final war council, the team agrees to mount a sneak attack on the village of Hillfar while the allied armies of the Drakelords overwhelm the Ox's forces.
* They team marches out from Drakkengrad with the full force of the Midlands at their side, and makes the journey to the east, to Hillfar.
* It takes several days, but on the morning of the 8th of Sevana, the army sits alongside a river, looking ahead to the clustered mesas of Hillfar, and the seat of the Ox's power.

### 8th of Sevana:

* The morning of reckoning has come. The army moves out to approach the base of the mesas, while the Greymoore Gang branches off on their own to take a different approach.
* Kaz, remembering the guidance of Rain, flys off on his own, positioning the Dolorconfluvium around the perimeter of the site of battle in a pentagonal arrangement.
* The team questions him, but he is evasive, shrugging off their inquiry.
* The army of the Ox runs and flies out to meet the armies of the Midlands, clashing in a horrible chaos of psonic powers and mundane and magical attacks.
* The Drakeriders charge into the fray, tossing the Ox's followers left and right.
* In the chaos, the team rides into Hillfar from the back side. Once they reach the center, they see him.
* The Ox stands atop the central mesa, looking out towards the battle in the distance. Without changing his stance, the team hears him telepathically reach out to them and beckons them to join him on top of the mesa.
* Spooked, but knowing it is all they can do, they ride up the central path to the top, and confront the Ox.
* Standing at his side is Vivian. She watches the party with hard eyes, having already met them in Roxton.
* The Ox tursn to the party. He is a bulky man, wearing a simple fur-lined coat open in the front to reveal a battle-scarred and muscular chest. On his head, he wears the skull of a black drake, covering his face. His eyes gleam from the dark pits of the skull, a brilliant blue.
* The Ox addresses the party: *"I have heard of your efforts. You united the Midlands against me, and managed to hold your own against my lieutenant, Vivian. You have great promise. Have you come to take the test, to see if you are worthy to join the future I make for us all?"*
* The team looks back and forth between each other. Ser speaks up, and states that the Ox's means will never justify the end, and the team has come to stop him. The Ox shrugs, and says that the party could have had a place in his world, but they are welcome to choose not to partake in it.
* The Ox doesn't move, but the team sees movement from the longhouse behind him. The door opens, and a massive white minotaur steps out, dragging a huge flail. Drakelord Beckuss, not dead but on the side of the Ox, appears.
* Vivian lowers herself into a crouch, and the team dives into combat. The true battle for the Midlands had begun.
* Ser and Kaz focus on Drakelord Beckuss, who charges at the team. Beckuss is quickly defeated and knocked unconscious.
* The Ox and Vivian throw psionic magic at the team, and they begin to throw back and forth spells and counterspells.
* As the fight escalates, the team comes under fire from psionic attacks from afar. Eventually, Dhamiria spots one of the Ox's lieutenants hiding in a tipi on another mesa. She shouts out the warning, and the team has to begin to revise their strategy to cope with the distant hiding lieutenants.
* At one point, the Ox charms Kaz, and dimension doors across the village to a distant mesa. Vivian and Zephyr face off atop the roof of the longhouse, and Dhamiria rides Mittens off to try to reach the Ox.
* Over the next minute, Dhamiria and Ser manage to lock down and finish off Finn, forcing Fayne to flee.
* During the battle, both Ser and Kaz are changed by the Ox, who blasts their minds with his power and connects them both to his hivemind. They see in their minds eye all the other followers of the Ox, fighting on the plains nearby.
* In the sky over the battle outside Hillfar, the team witnesses a glowing red pentagram form on the underside of the clouds overhead. It pulses with light, before disappearing as quickly as it appeared. Kaz suspects its related to the posts he placed into the ground before the battle.
* Vivian is knocked out from her duel with Zephyr, and the Ox rushes to her aid in a rage.
* Zephyr manages to blast the Ox as he rushes to help, and in his last moments of consciousness, he pours a healing potion down into Vivian's mouth.
* As he dies, Vivian comes back to life, just in time to witness Zephyr standing over the Ox's body.
* Vivan screams in horror and rage as the team closes in. Something seems to snap within her, and as the screams intensify, lightning begins to lash out off of her. A violent sphere of lightning begins to grow, like a Tesla coil arcing from Vivian's body to the surrounding terrain.
* As the team is about to be engulfed in the horrible surge of magic, it stops as abruptly as it began. A hooded and mysterious figure stands over Vivian, whispering into her ear. She looks shocked and horrified, tears running down her face, gazing at the body of the Ox. The two standing figures disappear as they teleport away.
* The team regroups, and removes the skull helmet from the Ox's body. Beneath it, a handsome man in his 30s lies motionless.
* Nearby the battle turns in the favor of the Drakelords, as the coordination of the psions falls apart without the Ox to connect them all.
* Limping down off the mesas of Hillfar, the Graymoore Gang reunites with the Drakelords' forces. Zephyr carries the skull helmet of the Ox as a token of their victory.
* The armies of the Midlands regroup and make camp, rounding up the remaining cultists, and everyone celebrates.
* Ova and Dhamiria hug in relief at making it through the battle.

### 9th of Sevana through the 15th of Sevana:

* On the return journey, Ser and Kaz manifest some psionic abilities from their exposure to the Ox and his hive mind. Ser can shove things with his mind, and Kaz can trick people into seeing illusions that aren't visible to anyone else.
* Drakelord Beckuss survived the battle with the Ox, and as he heals he thanks the team for freeing him from being dominated by the Ox's power. Beckuss and Djimon give the team the remaining two drakehide patches, completing their collection and marking them as heroes to the Midlands.
* The team is also paid a hefty gold reward. Ser asks for more, and he is allowed to attempt to bond with an orphaned white drake named Gnasher. Over the next few days, Ser spends hours coaxing and feeding the young drake to form a bond with it.
* One night, while the group is sleeping, Zehruut alerts Kaz that the "boss" wants a word with him. Kaz goes to the outskirts of the encampment, and there a voice fills his mind, the same voice her heard long ago speaking to him from a blue flaming fireplace. It thanks him for his efforts, and informs him that the test was a success. As a reward, it gifts him "Ambition." The tattoo on his chest bursts into blue flames, and a hilt of a sword emerges from it. Kaz grips the hilt, drawing out a long, jagged sword forged from blue metal and wreathed in blue flame. The fire dies out, and he returns to the tent, baffled but fixated on this magical weapon.
* Victorious, the armies of the Midlands return to Drakkengrad. The party is treated to a heroes' welcome, with the citizens of the city cheering as they return, throwing flowers and watching their triumphant procession. The party is hosted in the Drakelord's Castle, and allowed to partake in all of the foods and enjoy the hot springs.
* The party sleeps and rests, content in their victory...

## **LEVEL UP (8)**

### 16th of Sevana:

* Ser is determined to befriend the white drake. He visits the druid's refuge in Drakkengrad for instruction in how to cast Speak with Animals. 
* The party receives a letter from the Order of the Grasping Fist, congratulating them in their victory, and asking them to come to a dinner that night.
* For the rest of the day, the party travels around Drakkengrad, looking for tools that could help them in their investigation of the Locate Object spell where Zephyr felt a ping below the surface of the lake.
* Further investigation using Zephyr's Arcane Eye reveals that there is a crumbling stone tower at the bottom of the lake. A monstrous, merfolk-like creature lives in it, and it has been feasting of sunken ships and swimmers.
* The party decides to descend to deal with the beast, and seek out answers. They swim down together to the bottom of the lake.
* The monster is a Waistrilith, a Water Demon, and a far greater threat than anticipated. With the help of several lightning bolts and two Giant Octopi summoned by Ser, they manage to defeat the creature.
* Kaz uses his Devil's Sight to see through the walls of the cave, finding a cavern filled with air nearby. Exploring it, they find a small chamber containing a teleportation circle.
* The cavern appears to be a ruined Velki storage depot. Exploring it, they find various loot and notes about its purpose. Using a crystal from the Tower, they power the facility back up, bringing back the lights.
* They find a Potion of Self Immolation, which seems to be of dubious usefulness.
* In the next room, a pair of stone constructs come to life and attack, defending the room beyond.
* They are dispatched with some difficulty due to their magical resilience.
* The group uses the strange key they found on the locked door at the end of the hall. Instead of </br> unlocking it, they open a portal to another </br> realm filled with sunlight and grass </br> as far as the eye can see. A ***Chimera*** </br> resides there, and it turns all three </br> of its horrible heads to look </br> at them.
* They slam the door shut and remove the key, returning it to its inert form. The key is an *Arcane Key to Somewhere* with one remaining charge, capable of transforming any doorway into a portal to a random location in the multiverse.
* After that, they break the door down and smash into the ajoining room. It is a large cavern filled with old crates and boxes, seeming to be a storeroom of sorts.
* Inspecting the various boxes, the team discerns that four of the chests are magically locked, and there are four magical keys on a keyring that go to them. A riddle comes attached to the keyring...

1. *The wood key is two places to the right of the cursed chest.*
2. *The platinum is to the left of the chest that uses the silver key.*
3. *The third chest has either platinum or diamonds.*
4. *The cursed chest is directly to the left of the chest that uses the gold key.*
5. *The gold key is directly to the left of the trapped chest.*

* After a good amount of thought, Kaz looks into the chests with his ghost vision and sees the answers, bypassing the riddle and puzzle with ease. Everyone recovers the items they want without being cursed or trapped.
* As the group digs through the loot, they are suddenly assaulted by an invisible creature with sharp claws. Using a quick faerie fire, Ser manages to highlight the creature's location, allowing Kaz to slice it to bits with his flaming sword.
* After looting every corner of the cavern, and deciding nothing was left of value, the group uses Dimension Door to teleport out of the cave system and back to the surface of the lake.
* They return to the League of Blue Steel, and turn in the Wastrilith's teeth to collect the bounty.
* That night they go to the agreed upon dinner meeting with the Order of the Grasping Fist.
* They are treated to a fine dining experience at the Tower of the Fist in Drakkengrad, eating with Duke Janos.
* There are surpise appearances of Soliana and Otis from Leafside, who join them for the meal. 
* They reveal that debtors of the CCC often become *indentured adventurers* to pay off their dues. They also reveal that they are impressed by the group's subterfuge of their efforts in capturing Vorros back in Leafside without their knowledge.
* Seliana is Janos' daughter. Janos reveals that he has an issue with some of his airships being intercepted near Ebrea. Floatstone crystals are getting hard to come by, so he needs his airships back.
* After much discussion, the group agrees to help, if they can receive one of the recovered airships as payment. Since he has no evidence the airships will be in working order, Janos agrees.

### 17th of Sevana:

* Dhamiria visits the Raven Queen's temple, and recieves a vision of her Aunt Baraka, captured and held in a jail cell in a dark cave. The Raven Queen informs her of the Barbed Coronet of Lolth, an ancient evil artifact her Aunt was charged with protecting. 
* With this nebulous vision, and unsure if it has happened yet or will happen soon, Dhamiria suggests the party travel to her home village of Nyumbani to rescue her Aunt.
* Zephyr buys a magic +1 Hablberd off of the Crimson Riders guard captain for Dhamiria. Ser performs some new songs at the Vintner's Guild, describing the adventures of the Graymoore Gang and spreading his influence.

### 18th of Sevana through the 19th of Sevana:

* The team alerts Janos and his crew that they will be joining them. 
* Dhamiria gets some new tattoos of the Ox's Helmet from Janos' recommended tattoo parlor. A cute half-elf woman named Eliza is the tattooist at *Illustrious Inks*.
* Ser invites Gnasher the white drake along, and she agrees to join the adventure after much enticing.
* Everyone buys some health potions, and prepares for the journey.
* Dhamiria finally shoots her shot with Ova, and the two finally are able to figure out that they like each other, officially establishing their status as girlfriends.
* Ova and Dhamiria spend the evening together, as the rest of the team rests soundly within the comfort of the castle in Drakkengrad.
