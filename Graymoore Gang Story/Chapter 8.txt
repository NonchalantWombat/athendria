# Chapter 8 - The Perilous Peryton

### 25th of Nanook:

- Having finally returned to Drakkengrad, the party stops to enjoy the sun and catch their breath.
- The Deaconess of the Raven's Wing Sepulchre meets with Dhamiria and Aunt Baraka, and they explain the situation in private. She agrees to keep the Coronet safe at her temple, with Aunt Baraka's help. She chooses to stay there, allowing Dhamiria to continue on with her own personal journey.
- Kaz visits the Priests of Pelor for their special healing, to finally recover from the painful, lingering injury from being impaled by the ballista bolt in the Underdark. He makes a sizable "charitable" donation to encourage their help.
- The party then visits the Wind Trade Union's docks, speaking with an Aarakokra named Klucky Fitzle, who provides them with the control keys to their newly refurbished airship.
- The group boards the fixed and sky-worthy vessel, and begins to make plans for how to outfit it. At the bow, the stuffed and preserved head of the Dire Peryton sits mounted. In the front, a meeting room sits beneath the forecastle, and in the back, a room for sleeping and kitchen provide ample room for comfortable traveling.
- In the hold, there is plenty of room for the animals, and several bathrooms. The engine room is freshly cleaned and the floatstone core is at maximum charge.
- Zephyr is deemed the official captain of the Perilous Peryton, and the group pays several thousand gold to outfit their vessel with all the trappings and conveniences of an adventuring vessel (including two ballista).

- After completing their preparations, the Dockmaster hands them a letter from *Kelly Seekerton* with the following text:

"*To the Graymoore Gang,*

*Word has reached me at my place of study of your daring exploits! I want to congratulate you on your significant contributions to the Midlands at large, and your acquisition of such respect and admiration by the people there. Who would have thought the scrappy band of sellswords would end up achieving such heights?*

*It has been several months since we last met, and I wanted to extend an invitation to you all to come visit. My research continues unabated, and our brief time together was instrumental in my investigation. You demonstrated plenty of latent skill for such work then, and have proved beyond a shadow of a doubt to myself and many others your capacity for doing sensitive and difficult work.*

*At your convenience, please seek me at my place of residence at the city of Slateway. I promise to serve you a feast befitting heroes. I believe I also have a proposition you may find intriguing, based on our previous conversations; I am certain you are all well-equipped for the tasks I have in mind.*

*Respectfully, Your previous employer, fellow researcher and admirer,*

***Kelley Seekerton***

*P.S: If you come, ask for Kelley at the Halls of Antiquity. One of the automatons will direct you as necessary. Also, if you do decide to visit, please do so without drawing too much attention; many eyes watch your movements these days. Being famous does have its downsides.*"

- With this news in mind, the group heads to the League of Blue Steel to pick up some work to earn money and recoup their expenses.
- The previous quest the party had been eyeing is removed, apparently completed by someone else while the gang was off on adventures. The team encounters a half-dow man named **Bradogottir** (**Brad** for short), a badass gunslinger with a katana, and it becomes clear he has begun to complete these quests on his own. 
- The party takes on the commission for a shapechanging criminal, who has been on a crime spree around Drakkengrad. Some initial investigation reveals they have a fixation on rich people, and seem to be targeting the affluent.
- Before that however, the party goes for a celebratory meal in Groztown, sampling the finest Dwarven foodstuffs.
- Upon returning the Perilous Peryton that night, the team discovers a ship-warming gift from Duke Janos in the form of a rare bottle of **Liquid Gold** wine from **Pork and Cork** cellars.
- Late in the night, the party hears strangers board their ship. Dhamiria confronts them in the dark, and they reveal themselves to be a roguish band of Uryons, robotic citizens of the Uryon Confederation. They have come to the party with a proposition.
- The warforged band introduces themselves as the **Rustbuckets**, an undercover faction willing to pay the group 8500 gold to help them smuggle a secret package on their new airship to Lysanor.
- The leader, **Locke**, hates the Reznor Dominion, and is especially untrusting of Kazbiel. The other Rustbuckets go by **Sledge, Snag, and Scope**. 
- The party agrees to their terms, and asks for their help in finding the elusive shapeshifter. Locke shares a rumor that a priest had something important stolen from him recently. The Rustbuckets disappear into the night, to return at a later date with their package for transport.

### 26th of Nanook:

- Starting their investigation, the Greymoore Gang meets with a Priest of Erathis who was robbed of his crown. He describes the criminal as having an odd accent. Zephyr uses locate object on the crown, to track it to a brothel known as the Midnight Petal.
- After lying their way into speaking with the owner, Ser uses Modify Memory to force the owner to divulge his secrets. The owner describes the criminal who traded to crown for "services" as going by the name Mephistopheles, and he lives in the Mudwater Slums on the edge of the city.
- He also sometimes visits the Silken Sheets nearby, another brothel. The team heads to that location, and are surprised to see the descibed criminal striding out of the front doors. The group swarms him, trying to subdue him quickly. The man transforms into his true form, a rakshasa, and casts Fireball on himself to try and escape. Zephyr counterspells it. Then, he trys to mind control Dhamiria, but she manages to evade his efforts.
- Without warning, the bounty hunter Brad appears on a nearby rooftop, and begins to shoot at the rakshasa, attempting to get in on the action. Kaz throws up Darkness to prevent him from seeing their quarry. Ser traps the fiend with Dhamiria inside a summoned lead dome, and Dhamiria manages to overpower him with brute force, tying him up with magic rope.
- Victorious, the team warns off Brad and drags their prize to the League of Blue Steel. There, they seal the fiend into an iron coffin for unknown purposes. 
- The group is paid well, and end up buying Brad a drink and chatting through the night.
- Zephyr uses divination magic to locate the rest of the rakshasa's hidden treasure cache.

### 27th of Nanook:

- The next morning, everyone grabs some coffee and heads to the slums to seek out the rakshasa's treasure cache. After some divination magic and bribing of the locals, Zephyr locates the shack full of his loot. The group gathers up a ring of cold resistance, a ring of spell storing, and an unbreakable necklace.
- The rest of the day is spent shopping and selling miscellaneous loot. Zephyr embraces the spider aesthetic, dying her hair black and coloring her goggles red, and buying a red coat.
- That night, the Uryons arrive with their cargo, levitating a massive and very heavy crate onto the deck of the ship at midnight.
- The passengers hide themselves in the hay in the cargo hold, and the party departs early the next morning.

### 28th of Nanook:

- Today is the first voyage of the *Perilous Peryton*! It departs for Lysanor. The group breaks open the bottle of *Liquid Gold*, savoring its expensive flavor. Ser and Kaz practice with their armor, and Dhamiria practices sparring with Locke on the deck. 

### 1st of Eben through the 4th of Eben:

- After several days of team-building and practice, the grand city of Lysanor appears on the horizon. Zephyr's hometown, and home to multiple magical colleges of art and high magic. 
- Upon docking at the correct tower, the party leaves the Uryons behind in the ship's hold and walks across the city to visit Zephyr's parents.
- Zephyr's parents, Harry and Breeze, are very welcoming to the group and overjoyed to see their daughter again. Zephyr learns as they dine together in her childhood cottage that the **Unseen**, Lysanor's special agents, have been coming around. Her old mentor, Master Ook-Chin, has gone missing. Zephyr gives her parents a generous cash payment to help them pay off the student loans they took out for her, to ensure the Unseen will stop bothering them.
- That night, the group goes to the Clyria College of the Performing Arts, so Ser can participate in an open mic night.
- Ser does a great performance, and the listeners are surprised to hear that he belongs to the slightly famous Greymoore Gang, vanquishers of the Ox.
- The laster performer of the night is **Libretto the Loquacious**, a talented halfling bard and prior graduate of the college. Ser is impressed by his wordplay and rhythm, and stops him afterwards to discuss at length his methods. They become friends, and the group returns back to the airship to wait.
- At midnight, a masked and armored figure arrives on the deck. They seems curt and distant, and coordinate with the Rustbuckets to levitate the crate off the ship and carry it off into the city. The Rustbuckets identify the figure as a being named **Anathema**.
- That night, as Kaz is keeping watch, he receives a note attached to a dart that embeds itself into the mast of the ship. An unknown individual wants to meet with the group, and is curious about what they were smuggling. They identify themselves only as "**Mr. N**."

### 5th of Eben:

- That morning, Zephyr picks up her parents to give them a sky tour of the city. They are overjoyed to see everything from this vantage point, and are very impressed by Zephyr's successes. They share that Zephyr's old friend **Typhon** recently published a big article about his findings at the Tower on top of the Darkspires. Zephyr was not included in this article, and the Greymoore Gang were mentioned in the acknowledgements. 
- Annoyed, Zephyr insists upon meeting with Typhon to have a word about proper accreditation.
- After returning her parents, the group heads to the Fresh Biscuits Bakery to acquire some snacks and prepare for their secret meeting with Mr. N at noon. They purchase some coffee and snacks.
- In the alley behind the building, they find a secret brick button. Pressing it, the wall opens, allowing them to walk down into a secret room. A dwarf sits there, watching suspiciously, and lets them in to meet with Mr. N.
- In the following room, there is a small office with a nice desk and various scrolls. A cat with mismatched eyes sits on the desk, dozing. Mr. N appears to be invisible, and speaks to the party from the empty chair. He states that he is the leader of the **Thought Thieves**, a group partially interested in observing and undermining the Unseen in Lysanor.
- Mr. N claims some talent in the psionic arts, and congratulates the party on their defeat of the Ox.
- He remarks on their smuggling efforts, letting the team know that helping the Rustbuckets actually helps the Unseen, and by extension, **Archmage Thariune**. The individual who oversaw the hand-off (Anathema) is his general.
- He informs Zephyr that the Unseen "disappeared" Master Ook-chin, and he asks the group to help him undermine the Unseen directly.
- Dhamiria and Ser begin to prod at Mr. N seeking answers as to why his is invisible, and why is he so secretive. They eventually discern that Mr. N is, in fact, the cat sitting on the table, and not an invisible person. Seeing a bowl in the corner, they infer his true name to be **Mr. Nibbles**.
- Through mutual exchange of information, the team learns that Master Ook-Chin has been deported to work in the archives at the city of Slateway.
- After agreeing to cooperate with Mr. N in the future, the group leaves and heads to visit Typhon's new archeology lab, funded by his discoveries and publications.
- Zephyr has a tense conversation with Typhon, but they hash out a new agreement to not misunderstand each other and to work together on future Velkian investigations
- Typhon, as a gesture of goodwill, pays for a Scroll of Sending so that Zephyr can stay in touch with him in the future.
- Later, ser meets up with Libretto to have a jam session. It goes splendidly, and Ser collects some decent money from appreciative onlookers. Libretto offers to take the group out for dinner, and Zephyr asks to bring her parents.
- Zephyr and the rest of the group purchase fine clothes for the occassion. At dinner, they are introduced to the hobgoblin **Chef Caesar Rocco**, a famous cook and personal friend of Libretto.
- The meal is magnificent. After dinner, the Chef and Libretto sneak away to have a private conversation. Dhamiria, being nosy, decides to sneak after them and eavesdrop. She overhears something about some person called **"Hush"** taking flight once again, and the concerning developments with the Unseen. Confused by what she has overheard, Dhamiria returns to the dinner party undetected.
- After escorting Zephyr's parents home, the group walks back to their airship. Along they way, they are accosted by a group of unruly, inebriated students. After a short scuffle, where Ser polymorphs the leader and Zephyr slows them with magic, they others continue to escalate the encounter. 
- Suddenly, from the shadows, a dozen or so hooded and masked figures appear. Their presence immediately calms and quiets the unruly group, and they solemnly scurry off. The Greymoore Gang watches apprehensively, but the figures merely give them a silent stare before retreating to the shadows and disappearing.
- Unnerved, the team boards their airship. Feeling paranoid, they investigate the ship for tampering. They find a tracking device mounted to the steering column of the airship, and Dhamiria uses her Finding Goggles to track the location of the creature that placed it.
- The team launches the ship and follows her lead, which directs them to a lone figure standing atop the Archmage's Tower. The dim light reveals them to be Anathema, the general of the Unseen. As the figure looks on, the team flys away, tossing the tracking device overboard. 
- Attempts at divination magic meet a powerful countercharm on the Tower, indicating the Archmage has permanently warded its interior from magical scrying.
- The party departs for Drakkengrad, making the return journey quickly.

## **LEVEL UP (10)**

### 6th of Eben through the 8th of Eben:

- On the return to Drakkengrad, Kaz and Ser continue their armor training. Zephyr commits the spell *Sending* to her spellbooks, and begins to reach out to old contacts and share information.
- After returning, the party completes the paid-for ship upgrades and acquires new clothes and equipment.
- Zephyr casts Sending to Master Ook-chin, but he seems to have no memory of who Zephyr is, and seems content to be working at Slateway.

### 9th of Eben through the 12th of Eben:

- The team departs for Slateway, flying in their newly equipped airship. The park their airship outside of town behind some hills.
- Upon arrival, they all observe the massive pit that descends into the earth near the edge of Slateway, the opening known as *Vexyll's Pit*.
- The locals are primarily employed by mining practices into the region around the Pit. Those who unearth valuable relics and artifacts sell them to *Archmage Vexyll, the Archmage of Antiquity*.
- Using some magical coersion, the group lies their way into town and heads to the Halls of Antiquity, seeking out their old friend Kelly Seekerton. The talk to an Automaton called the **Curator**, who takes them to a hidden elevator.
- The ride up the elevator takes over five minutes, seemingly traveling a far greater distance than the exterior of the Tower of Inquiry would suggest is possible.
- At the top, they enter a spacious room filled with magic relics, statues, fossils, and more. Standing on the opposite side of the room is a woman they don't recognize. She identifies herself as **Archmage Vexyll**, also called, to some of her friends... **Kelly Seekerton**.
- The team is shocked to learn that Kelly was an undercover alias for the Archmage herself. She apologizes and explains how she extracted some form of mobile factory from the ruins near Greymoore, using the device she brought with her and with their help.
- She explains her knowledge of their fight and victory against the Ox. She then asks them to explore the ancient, dangerous ruins deep alongside Vexyll's Pit, explaining that she suspects more ancient technology like the strange object she brought to Greymoore may reside there.
- The group agrees, and sets out down into the pit with Vexyll leading the way. They descend along the wall of the massive hole, and Vexyll explains her theory the pit is a portal to another realm; no one who has ever descended into it has risen back from it again (it likely leads to the Nine Hells).
- After arriving at the mouth to a deep cave system near the pit, Vexyll explains she wants the team to find and obtain another Quintessehedron, a power-storing device like the one she had in Greymoore. Her attempts at delving into the Ascendant ruins here have met with danger, so she is enlisting the team to do it for her.  
- Vexll also reveals that Master Ook-chin does indeed work in her archives, seemingly without coercion.
- Ser asks if she has any knowledge about the Darkness in Olmothia, but she is unable to provide further insights. She suggests the Bladewitches may know more, but they are very secretive.
- Vexll offers to pay the team 11,000 gold in exchange for an intact Quintessehedron. They agree, but head to the archives first to find Master Ook-chin.
- After arriving there, he seems to have no recollection of Zephyr. He cautiously agrees to have a healing spell cast upon him at a later date.
- That night, as the team sleeps aboard the Perilous Peryton, Kaz is notified by Zehruut that he must meet with someone. Kaz goes out to meet him, and has a conversation once again with the enigmatic entity known as **Rain**. The shifter hands over a bag full of spheres covered in strange runes, telling Kaz to "fill" them, and referring to them as *Dolorvasculo*.
- Zephyr spies on this discussion, and confronts Kaz when he returns. He agrees to share with the group about any future interactions with his associates.

### 13th of Eben:

- After paying some locals to feed their animals, the team meets with Vexyll to being their descent. They feather fall as a group down a long tunnel and begin exploring.
- Along the way, they find some corpses of previous adventurors, and trigger some gas traps by accident.
- In a large cavern, the group is attacked by phase spiders and cave fishers. Ser is reeled away by a long cast thread, and Kaz uses Dimension Door and flight to pull him back. Zephyr uses various magics to rend the monsters, and Dhamiria runs about, slashing and hacking at the beasts.
- Eventually all the spiders fall, and the team progresses even further into the depths.
- They pause to take a break in a ruined chapel of sorts, containing a shrine to the dead with six small flags. Emblazoned on a plaque, the team reads the following message:

*"Honor the dead, the dying, the lost.*

*Honor their deeds with the ferryman's cost.*

*Honor, don't gloat, those who have passed,*

*With words of peace and pride Amassed"*

- The team does their best to appease the riddle, managing to perform a variety of funeral rites and raise the flags partially. As a reward, they find a tomb containing a set of fine elven chainmail, a ring of jumping, and some rare gemstones.
- Descending even further, the team stumbles upon a strange, purple and green furred, lupine creature. Zephyr blocks the beast away from the party with a Wall of Force, but another strange beast appears from behind them! Zehruut jumps into action, and surprisingly puts it to sleep right away with his potent poison stinger.
- Dhamiria dispatches the sleeping beast, while the party prepares to jump on the other monster. After they are defeated, the team finds the origin of these beasts further down the tunnel: a strange laboratory filled with vats with strange liquid. Once such vat seems to contain something moving, but the team decides to ignore it and continue on their way.
- Further down the path the party arrives at a massive door, seemingly sealed with powerful magic. Before it, a series of statues are arranged in a circle, with a strange pattern of images and lines engraved into the floor.
- After further study, Ser determines the images depict a ritual dance, to deactivate the magic seal. Ser and Kaz perform the dance, and the doorway unlocks. As they open it, a wave of hot dry air washes over them, and they decide to stop and take a rest outside the gate.
- After several hours, their rest is disturbed by a horrific, long-armed monster with too many mouths. It has an anti-magic aura, and rapidly shreds Kaz and Ser's health. Dhamiria attacks it, but barely manages to escape. Zephyr summons the Bagman to drag Kaz to safety, outside the antimagic aura to give him a chance for magical healing.
- Ser panics and tries to re-open the seal with a dance, but he messes up the process, causing the statues to spring to life and begin attacking everyone.
- In the chaos, the team manages to disrupt the beast's anti-magic aura by breaking its concentration, then it is quickly destroyed with Kaz's magic. Dhamiria starts attacking the remaining statues, and the team stands badly damaged and barely alive. Kaz runs to the circle and completes the dance, which deactivates the remaining statues. They return to their posts, and the party collapses in exhaustion.
- Ser casts Tiny Hut, and the team huddles inside to slowly heal and sleep off the pain. The magic barrier reemerges with time, and they dread having to do the dance one more time in the morning.

### 14th of Eben:

- The players leave behind a large rock, and use it to jam open the magic door. They descend into the heated hallway beyond, and descend into the ruins of **Kalag Dur**. After a long walk, they enter a massive cavern, illuminated dimly from the light of dozens of lava pools. The ruins of hundreds of ancient buildings fills the space, scattered around the lava. They also quickly find petrified statues of people, specifically Ascendants, going about their lives. Scattered between the people, they also find petrified fiends, including a Pit Fiend at one point.
- The city was obviously hit with some kind of magical catastrophe. Zephyr suspects that the ancient Blood War of the demons and devils must have spilled over into this city at some point.
- Near the center of town, a congregation of statues stand frozen, arranged around a large spherical stone orb. Emeralds are growing out of it. It bears a striking resemblence to the stone orb they found all the way back at the Clattering Keep. 
- Ser loots some magical powder off of one of the statues, which grants *Truesight* momentarily. The team uses a pinch, and they all observe that the orb has some powerful, ancient runes on its surface, forming some kind of containment enchantment.
- The group heads to the center of the city, where they find a dilapidated building with hundreds of tubes and pipes flowing into it. They enter, and see pools of lava everywhere, and another path going even deeper underground.
- As they attempt the cross the hall, they are attacked by a flying Eye Monster who calls himself **Xylagretch**. The abomination cackles and attacks the group, triggering a trap that slams doors down over the entrance and exit.
- The team dives into action, gingerly jumping from column to column amidst the boiling lava below. The monster blasts out with a variety of deadly eye-beams and chaotic effects. Ser and Kaz are knocked down by the attacks, and Zephyr and Dhamiria barely manage to defeat the horror and save their friends from a firey death.
- Dhamiria takes an amulet of lava walking from its corpse, and the team proceeds onward. Descending into the earth, they enter a massive cavern, where the skeleton of a titan lies amongst lava waterfalls. Magma elementals roam the space, and a mysterious bright red glow emenates from a cave mouth adjacent to the skull of the titan. The team fights past the elementals, and climbs the skeletons towards the cave.
- There, they discover a brand new Quintessahedron; this one however, is well over double the size of the one Vexyll brought to Greymoore. It sits in a cradle, obviously siphoning energy from all the magma around them.
- As they group begins to suffer from the intense heat, Dhamiria charges ahead to grab the Quintessahedron. She rips it out of its cradle, tearing tubes out as she does. Instantly, the facility begins to rupture and crumble around the group, as they realize what they've just done.
- The party turns and begins to flee for their lives, carrying the strangely weightless Quintessahedron behind them. They run back through the various chambers of the ruined city, using all their remaining magic and skill to dodge lava flows, falling rocks, collapsing statues and earthquakes.
- They burst out into the cooler caves of Vexyll's Pit, but the lava is rising rapidly. With no time to lose, they fly the remainder of the way back up and out of the ruins, bursting out onto the surface, far from the danger below.
- They watch as lava begins to pour of the caves far below, falling deep into the bottomless Pit.
- The group meets with Vexyll, explaining their journey and turning over the Quintessahedron.
- As thanks, Vexyll reveals some information regarding the Darkness in the Olmothian Woods. The Great Alder, at the deepest heart of the forest, has some kind of blight upon it. Her investigation is being stymied by the Alder Conclave, who are not replying to any attempts at communication.
- The Bladewitches are similarly unhelpful to Vexyll, so she is limited in what she knows. She suggests the players seek them out and trade with them to learn more. Their base is north of the town of Drollport.
- Zephyr heads to the archives and brings a spell scroll of Greater Restoration to fix Master Ook-chin. The enchantment removed, he recalls Zephyr and the events that led to his capture. The Archmage Thariune had him captured by the Unseen and his memories stolen before sending him here to work as a clerk. He had unmasked one of the Unseen, which is serious crime in Lysanor. The unmasked man was seemingly unremarkable, with blonde hair and a beard.
