## **LEVEL UP (12)**

</div>

- Having saved her father and with the party being banned from returning to Lysanor, Zephyr gathers her parents in a joyful reunion abord the Perilous Peryton. Everyone makes the return journey to Drakkengrad.
- On the trip Zephyr completes her athletic training with Dhamiria. 

### 21st of Nimbus (7 Months, 28 Days):

- Zephyr places her parents into the abandoned hut previously owned by the Rakshasa. She gives them some cash, and they quickly hit it off with the local famers. The party regroups and discusses the other pressing issues facing the party.
- Ser purchases some rare gems in order to cast *Awaken* on Mittens. In doing so, Mittens gains intelligence and speech, and is somewhat shocked by his new awareness of his place in the world. He seems to have a crisis regarding his role as a pet, and his past enjoyment of hunting wild animals.
- Ser and Zephyr agree to fly the Peryton to the Olmothian Woods and attempt to delve deeper in the spreading darkness, while Kaz and Dhamiria agree to teleport to his home, Kellanora, and resolve the topic of Kaz's family problems and Dhamiria's father, who was revealed by Aunt Baraka to be alive and in hiding within the Reznor Dominon.

## Ser and Zephyr

- After Dhamiria and Kaz teleport away with Mittens, Ser and Zephyr head to the Archives of Ioun. Ser voices his concerns regarding how to make the Tabor work, and they spend the day reading through ancient tomes to infer its function. In collaboration with a librarian who procures a scroll of Legend Lore, they learn the Tabor has a very long and unfathomable history, involving the Great Sundering, as well as being wielded by many other bards of old.
- Ser and Zephyr pilot the airship away from Drakkengrad, to the west, taking the next several days to prepare for the woods. Ser begins practicing with the Tabor, experimenting with trying to coax out its magical properties.

### 25th of Nimbus (8 Months, 4 Days):

- On the third day of the journey, as they fly over the region near Greymoore, the flying city of Stjarnaheim suddenly appears in a flash in the sky off the coast. The sudden appearance creates a maelstrom of wind and force, and the pressure wave nearly wrecks the ship. Ser and Zephyr barely hold it together, and the Peryton limps onward in the aftermath. Stjarnaheim disappears shortly after.
- They stop in Greymoore to drop off some gold, to show appreciation for the humble town of their origins.

### 26th of Nimbus (8 Months, 5 Days):

- Arriving in Oakheart, Ser visits with his mentor and family again. The team's past efforts to bolster Oakheart's defenses have held, but the darkness continues to spread. Multiple of the villagers are beginning to show signs of crystal growths, and some claim to be able to hear a distant ominous singing.

### 27th of Nimbus (8 Months, 6 Days):

- After resting, Ser and Zephyr head into the darkened part of the Olmothian Deepwoods, seeking the Alder Conclave to seek a solution to the Darkness, and to leverage to power of the Tabor if possible.
- Large, unnatural mushrooms and crystalline growths have sprouted everywhere. Ser speaks with a squirrel that has a partially crystal body, and convinces it to help guide their path. The forest begins to shimmer and display aspects of havoc haze all around, so the team puts on their havoc haze goggles and forges onward.
- Ser takes to playing the tabor, which seems to keep the oppressive darkness and havoc haze at bay. After wandering for what seems like a day or longer, the squirrel beckons them onward, having arrived at the deepest part of the woods.
- They enter a clearing, where a small outdoor market sits vacant. A large shrine at the far end of the clearing sits between them and the Great Alder, a gargantuan tree beyond the clearing.
- As lightning flashes overhead, they notice that the villagers are both present and not present; they are only visible, walking about in the flashing of the light. Otherwise, the space seems to be deserted. It is all deeply ominous.
- Suddenly, they are attacked by dark fey creatures, and they fight their way out of it with difficulty. Proceeding past the Shrine to Melora, they head towards the base of the **Great Alder**.
- Approaching the base, everything begins to be formed fully from crystal. The trees and rocks are all fully transmuted, and it begins to be evident that there is some sort of crystal growth or explosion, frozen in space, originating from the base of the tree.

- They are assaulted by a shadowfell monster, which Ser manages to polymorph the beast and dimension door it into the sky. It falls to its demise, and they approach the origin of the Darkness.
- Here, the humming is loud and omnipresent; a dark an unsettling tune that digs into the mind. Ser's gentle drum beat on the Tabor is all that keeps it at bay. At the heart of it all, they find a large clear crystal, within which they can make out the form of multiple humanoid figures standing in a circle, in the midst of casting some kind of spell.
- Nearby, they see Old Silverhands frozen in crystal, reaching his hands towards the center of the circle. Sensing this living crystal as the source of the Darkness, and ready to take action, Ser raises the Tabor and strikes a powerful beat to banish its influence. With a pulse of light and sound, a sonic wave cracks the crystal, and it begins to crumble. The humming falters and stops, and all around them the crystalline growths begin to disintegrate.
- As the crystal collapses into sand, so too do the trapped figures inside the heart of the structure. Seen clearly, it is a circle of druids who had all been holding hands in a magic circle. Chief among them, an earth genasi druid leaning on a resplendent wooden staff, turns to Zephyr and Ser and asks, "What have you done?"
- In that moment, the entire clearing trembles. The ground cracks, and the tiled floor churns into chaos, falling into an opening hole. In the darkness of the hole, a brilliant glowing pink eye opens and looks out.
- The psionic song begins anew, but this time with words in Draconic, with a might and intensity that overwhelms the senses. The Druids flee, stumbling, and Ser and Zephry fly up and away from the choas.
- Rising from the rubble, uncoiling from the earth, a gargantuan Dragon with crystalline pink glittering scales emerges. Its long flowing serpentine body uncoils from the valley, leaving a chasm in its wake. It floats into the sky, roaring its psionic song of awakening as it does. It is at least 1500 ft long, or more.
- The clouds part overhead as the dragon ascends into the sky, singing its triumph as it leaves. It drifts away into the distant horizon, leaving behind a scene of crumbled stone, ruined earth, and a mighty valley where its body had rested.
- In that moment of emergence, ancient, primal knowledge floods Athrendria. Some ancient magic broken, every sentient being becomes aware: **Atrexalon, God of the Gemstone Dragons**, has returned.

- Ser and Zephyr regroup with the druids near town, where the townsfolk have dropped out of etherealness and are looking around in bewilderment. The earth genasi druid introduces herself as **Lady Spinel**, and explains what has just occurred.
- The Alder Conclave of the Olmothian Woods became aware that there was an entity beneath the Great Alder many months ago. The humming and subtle earthquakes alerted them to its presence. Spinel, along with her friend the wizard Gowron of Lutetia, arrived to attempt to determine what it was. No amount of their powerful magic could reveal what it was, its name, its intention, or otherwise. Fearing what it could be, the druids agreed to a sealing ritual, led by Spinel and Gowron, to keep the entity from waking up.
- What occurred instead was a failure, and all it did was delay the awakening. The power of Atrexalon is inevitable, and the druid ritual became corrupted by his potent draconic magic, transforming into living crystal and corrupting the Olmothian woods with the *Darkness*.
- With Ser's Tabor, he banished the Darkness, but in doing so also allowed Atrexalon to fully awaken. With his escape, the third Dragon God of the triad, previously unknowable, has returned to wander Athendria and wreck untold havoc.

## Kaz and Dhamiria

- Meanwhile, Kazbiel, Dhamiria and the newly awakened Mittens attempt to teleport to *Kellenora*, Kaz's home and the ancestral holy city of the Reznor.
- The teleport unfortunately goes awry, and the group finds themselves fighting off a demonic hyena deep in sweltering jungle. After defeating the beast, they attempted the teleport again, this time achieving the correct destination.
- There, Dhamriria pretends to be a noblewoman from Yvat'Los, and potential fiancee to Kaz. They are escorted from the teleportation circle across town to the Hall of Emergence, where Kaz's mother, **Duchess Olonida Daetoris**, holds court. A beautiful and intimidating tall drow noblewoman, she strides across the hall to inspect her bastard son and his bride-to-be.
- After some tense and awkward words, she invites them to dinner to talk more informally.
- They return to Kaz's childhood home, a mansion overlooking the drow city. At dinner, Dhamiria meets Kaz's two siblings, Indra and Yuminar Daetoris. They adopt different attitudes towards Kaz, with Yuminar being stiff and formal, while Indra is insulting and casual. 
- The dinner is tense, with lots of discussion. The Duchess reveals she wishes for Kaz to become an ambassador for Kellenora, due to his success out in the world against the Ox, and earning a reputation for himself.
- After dinner, Kaz and Dhamiria wander the gardens and confront Indra, who becomes especially nasty towards Kaz.

<div class='footnote', style="color:white"> Chapter 10 | Split the Party</div>



- She tells Kaz he is unworthy, and she will never acknowledge him. If she has the chance, she will gladly cut him down for being a traitor. She leaves in a huff.
- Kaz and Dhamiria accompany the Duchess to the armory, where she gifts Dhamiria a **Siphon Glaive** as a wedding gift.
- The Duchess speaks with Kaz alone in his room, offering him the outfit of a Reznor Ambassador, the highest position within Reznor society for a noble of lesser birth. Kaz is wary and confronts her, being direct and not trusting her offer. She reveals in annoyance that she is also a Warlock of the Fiend, like him, but unlike him she has finesse and she would never get caught. She praises him again for his recent accomplishments, and claims ownership of his growth, stating that he was banished to prompt his maturation. She chastizes Kazbiel for his ignorance and naivety, and offers him the job one last time.
- Kaz turns her down, and she leaves the chambers in disgust.
- After Dhamiria and Kaz confer in private, they hear footsteps approaching. Not trusting the hospitality of his mother, they both flee the room through the window, and retrieve Mittens from the stables. 
- Moments later they are spotted by the would-be-assassins who had come to their rooms to kill them, and alarm bells start ringing.
- The two rapidly flee the mansion grounds, and Kaz makes good use of the *Mislead* spell to distract and confuse the pursuing assassins.
- The two flee into the lower city, now seeking the blacksmithy where Dhamiria learned her father may be in disguise.
- After talking to some locals and doing some digging, they find the simple blacksmithy, and run into a stout drow man leaving at that moment. Confronting him and revealing her tattoos, Dhamiria is reunited with her father, **Amani**, who beckons them inside.
- Amani explains how he was been watching the Reznor for years in secret as a spy for the Kubiri, and a recent traveling blacksmith who knew about the Kubiri came to sell her wares, which peaked the interest of the Duchess. Sensing the Kubiri may be in danger, he sent the raven messenger to Aunt Baraka as a warning and a request for rescue. He is overwhelmed to be rescued by his daughter, who has grown so big.
- Dhamiria is horrified to learn that the traveling blacksmith is none other than the elven smith she traded with back in Leafside. By sharing knowledge about her people, she has alerted the Reznor to their presence and endangered them all.
- Before they can share further, Reznor guards flood the streets, knocking on doors and looking for Kaz and Dhamiria. Together, they forge a plan for escape with Amani, and Kaz heroically volunteers to be a distraction. 
- The group jumps into action. Kaz activates his flaming blue wings, unsheathes his blue flame sword, and rockets into the sky in a firey display that quickly brings all attention in the city onto him.

\columnbreak

- In that moment, Dhamiria and Amani mount up on Mittens and they stealth away through back alleys and jump over the wall, fleeing into the pine forests around the city at the base of the Darkspires.
- Meanwhile, Kaz quickly begins to regret his role in this plan. Drow sentries on the battlements take aim and begin to fire ballista and magic at him as he flies over the streets of Kellenora.
- A ballista bolt strikes him again, and he careens down like a firey comet, barely clearing the wall and crashing into the forests as his magic runs out. Badly injured, and disoriented, Kaz stumbles into the woods and seeks to escape the pursuit of the many Reznor sentries hot on his tail.
- Kaz and Dhamiria stumble through the forest, trying to find a way to signal each other and regroup to escape, but they can't find each other in the vast forest. In desperation, Dhamiria thinks to call Dame Ova with her sending stone, and begs her to assist somehow. Ova, far away in Bulghraz, runs to wake Dame Symone, a cleric who can use sending to contact Kazbiel and attempt to coordinate. Kaz recieves the sending from Symone, and through Symone and Ova as an inbetween, Kaz and Dhamiria are able to find a mutual point of reference and converge on a nearby landmark.
- As they find each other, with the help of Zehruut scouting overhead, Kaz begins to draw the teleportation circle to make their escape. However, the Reznor sentries are close behind, and are visible through the trees converging on their location. Just as the sentries begin to summon fireballs and throw spears at them, Kaz completes the circle and they all make their escape back to Drakkengrad, moments before disaster.
- Exhausted, Kaz collapses, and Dhamiria and Amani carry him to a nearby tavern to spend the night and tend to his wounds. After taking care of Kaz, Amani and Dhamiria stay up through the night, talking about their lives apart and reconnecting the father-daughter relationship that Dhamiria thought she may never have.
