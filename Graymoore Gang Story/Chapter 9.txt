# Chapter 9 - Deeper Darkness

## **LEVEL UP (11)**

### 14th of Eben through the 20th of Eben:

- The gang departs Slateway with Master Ook-Chin in tow. They travel to Drakkengrad once more, to leave him there and position him for a new life teaching far from the machinations of the Archmages. The team goes shopping for supplies and to prepare for a journey to the Olmothian Woods.
- The group departs Drakkengrad, heading for the coastal town of Drollport on the western edge of Ikesh. There, they hope to ask for directions to the Bladewitches, to discover what secrets they hold about the Darkness.

### 21st of Eben to the 23rd of Eben:

- Zephyr spends the journey training on her physical fitness under Dhamiria's leadership, while Kaz and Ser train with medium armor. Dhamiria calls Dame Ova with their sending stones  often.
- While over the Olmothian Woods, a flock of flying snakes and a wyvern attack the airship. After defeating them, Ser notices that the snakes have odd crystalline growths on their bodies. That night, Ser begins to hear a distant humming tune carried on the wind, almost like a vague song.
- After arriving at Drollport, the team rests at the tavern named the Tacky Clam, and meet with a couple Bladewitches who are staying there. They give the group directions to their home base deep in the woods to speak with the Mothers, after trading some information.

### 24th of Eben:

- The team journeys into the deep woods, following the path laid out for them by the Bladewitches. Eventually, they grow aware that they are being watched. A dozen or so of the bladewitches are watching and following them in secret. They eventually find the compound of their order, and after confirming their previous interactions with other witches, they are granted an audience with the Mothers.
- The Mothers are two ancient hags called **Ruth** and **Agnes**. Both of the entities live in the same body, and monstrosity with dozens of tiny feet. The hags promise information about the darkness in exchange for examining Kazbiel's memories of their encounter with the Ox. After agreeing, they greedily study his memories and seem satisfied.
- In return for these secrets, they share what they know about the Darkness. It is originating from the heart of the Alder Conclave, from the Great Alder itself. Previously, **Old Silverhands** came through this way seeking answers and traveled deeper into the forest.
- The Darkness is associated with strange crystals that grow on the forest and the creatures in it alike. The Mothers do not know its true origin or nature. They offer to the players to consult with the Oracle for a deeper understanding.
- Ser agrees to meet with the oracle, since he is desperate for any advantage he can get. In the back of the hut, the Mothers pull back a curtain to reveal a pitch black tunnel. Traveling into it, the team experiences a sense of vertigo and movement that indicates some form of planar travel.
- On the other side, they step onto </br> a floating chunk of ruined black </br> stone, where a glowing green </br> lantern filled with swirling </br> light sits on a precipice over </br> a bottomless sea of stars. </br> Zephyr recognizes this space </br> as the *Astral Sea*.
- The group approaches the </br> lantern, and, noticing </br> bloodstains on the rock </br> before it, offers it a </br> blood sacrifice. This </br> seems to awaken a </br> being that resides </br> within the lantern, </br> and it grants visions </br> of a mystical </br> instrument known </br> as the **Tabor of </br> Rhu'Darok**.
- It tells the party that </br> this ancient instrument </br> of power may be the only </br> way to combat the </br> *Darkness*, as it was used in </br> the distant past to do so </br> long, long ago.
- In order to learn more about this instrument, they need to seek information from disreputable sources who may know of its location.
- The team leaves behind the lantern, the Mothers, and the compound to return to their airship in Drollport.

### 25th of Eben through the 28th of Eben:

- After returning to the airship, the team flies to the north, seeking out Ser's hometown **Oakheart**. Ser begins to grow crystals out of his leg, seemingly connected to his awareness of the strange magical humming within the woods. Over these couple days, everyone begins to hear the music.
- Arriving at Oakheart, the team marvels at the small village in the deep woods. All the homes are grown out of the trees and their trunks, and the population is shocked by the arrival of the airship. Ser introduces the gang to his family.
- Ser's sister is named **Brassica**, another firbolg. The town is mostly firbolgs, humans, and elves. AFter returning to Ser's childhood home, the team meets her adoptive father, **Elder Hammond**.
- He graciously hosts the party and asks them to stay the night, so they can celebrate the coming of the New Year and the last day of the Night Festival with them tomorrow.
- The next morning, the team is served a colossal breakfast and they participate in the festivities. There is a drinking contest, an eating contest, a bull elk riding contest, an arm wrestling contest, boulder and log throwing contest, a bar hanging contest, archery, dart throwing, rock throwing into cups, an obstacle course with balance beams and the like, a poetry writing contest, a chess tournament, an open dance floor, a debate forum, and finally the main attraction: a cooperative tree cutting contest, some card games, and a large obstacle course all around Oakheart.
- Zephyr loses to Elder Hammond in a game of dragonchess, but she later manages to almost win in the obstacle course. Once again however, Dhamiria's natural ability wins out and she wins the race. Zephyr is awarded an oaken tankard as a consolation prize.
- As the festivities continue, they are cut short by horrific, animalistic shrieks from the woods. Two misshappen, crystal-growth covered animals stagger out of the woods and into town. The team fights them back, managing to slay the monsters, but observe their strange magical resistance as a result of their crystal growths.
- This shock puts a damper on the festivities, and the party is ended early.

### 1st of Nimbus through the 5th of Nimbus, the year 1128:

- On the first day of the new year, Ser heads out bright and early to cast Plant Growth and summon walls of plants to protect Oakheart from the encroaching Darkness.
- Needing to learn more about the darkness and the location of this ancient artifact, the team boards their airship and flies off to seek out Lysanor once again, and to ask help of Mr. N and his network of informants.
- On the ensuing trip, Zephyr trains further with Dhamiria while Kaz improves his skill with medium armor.
- Zephyr receives a sending from Typhon, informing her that he is preparing an expedition to the Ceaseless Squall. Additionally, Zephyr learns from her mother that her father has disappeared, failing to return from work one day.

### 6th of Nimbus:

- After arriving in Lysanor, Zephyr quickly teleports her mom, Breeze, to Drakkengrad where she can stay safe with Master Ook-Chin. Her dad Harry is still nowhere to be seen.
- The group meets with Mr. N, and discusses all the issues at hand. Mr. N suspects the Unseen are behind Zephyr's dad's disappearance, but he does note that it is strange he would target her dad specifically.
- Mr. N shares that an individual known as **Hush** has begun to disrupt the Unseen's operations at night, and Mr. N wants to speak with him to find out if collaboration is an option. The team agrees to set up a sting operation to lure in Hush in exchange for Mr. N's intel regarding the *Tabor of Rhu'Darok* and the *Darkness*.
- With Mr. N's input, the team arranges for a meeting with a buyer known only as Miss K. They head to the rendezvous, anticipating that Hush will jump her and steal the item from her to prevent her from trading it with the Unseen.
- After trading with Miss K, </br> the gang follows her </br> secretly. Indeed, a </br> hooded shadowy figure </br> jumps her and steals </br> the scroll. Dhamiria </br> leaps out from hiding </br> and sees his face, </br> identifying him as </br> a hobgoblin of </br> some sort.
- Hush rapidly attempts to flee, but Zephyr sends the earth elemental after him, grabbing his ankles from the ground. Dhamiria grabs hims as well, but he releases a cloud of invisibility dust on them all and escapes. Ser flies in and uses Truesight powder to find him again, and the chase continues.
- Dhamiria uses misty step to catch up to him and restrain him, while Zephyr attacks him with her mind. Kaz appeals to him to calm him down, asking to communicate.
- As the chaos calms, the team sees his face clearly, recognizing him as **Chef Caesar Rocco**, the famous cook who knows **Libretto** and previously served them a meal.
- Before they can talk, Unseen begin to converge on the location, following the noise. Casting fly, they all flee the area and follow Caesar to one of his safehouses. He eventually agrees to a meetup with Mr. N, stating that their interests overlap regarding the undermining of the Unseen.
- Meanwhile, Zephyr feels her alarm spell activate, notifying her that someone has stepped onto their airship in their absence. They return quickly, and stalk around nearby to witness the form of **Anathema**, Archmage Thariune's general, leap from the ship and begin walking back towards the tower.
- Ser follows nearby, still invisible, and uses detect thoughts to try to peer into Anathema's mind...
- As their minds brush against each other, Ser instantly recognizes the thought patterns and color of the entity before them, behind the mask; it is **Vivian**, the right-hand of the Ox who had been teleported away in the final moments of their battle.
- A powerful psion herself, Vivian instantly senses Ser's intrusion, and whips around to fire lighting into the air. The team flees before her, running invisibly to Mr. N's hideout. Vivian shoots up a flare for assistance as the group flees. Arriving at Mr. N's hideout, they give him all the intel they have to share about Hush and Vivian, even more info that Kaz is hesitant to share, as Mr. N extracts it with his own psychic abilities.
- Mr. N holds up his side of the deal, telling the team about the fabled Tabor, suggesting it was once held in a collector's museum, but then it was stolen by a sneaky red dragon. This dragon is rumored to have also stolen a teleportation circle stone, and Mr. N pulled some strings to acquire its sequence.
- The team learns the sequence and thanks Mr. N. They now have an ongoing working relationship with the crime boss feline and his network. They sleep overnight in his lair to give the Unseen and Vivian time to calm down.

### 7th of Nimbus:

- Having gotten all the need from Mr. N, the team quietly heads over the Bartleby University to meet with Typhon and discuss his next expedition. Typhon is interested in studying three locations: The Ceaseless Squall, the Isles Gravitaas, and the floating city of Stajrnaheim.
- Archmage Thariune is funding the project and provided transport ships, in collaboration with the mobile city of Flotsam and the University of Uthorim.
- After debating with Typhon, the group agrees to target the Ceaseless Squall first, and to send the expedition there in a month. Typhon agrees.
- The team returns to their airship, and carefully combs over it, finding another tracking device. Zephyr finds a letter from Vivian, stating that she has captured Zephyr's father. Zephyr vows revenge against Vivian and to rescue her father.
- Vivian indicates that the team is to meet her in the hills outside Lysanor in one week's time. 

### 8th of Nimbus:

- The team flies to Slateway as they prepare to teleport to the location of the dragon's lair using the teleportation sequence they acquired from Mr. N. They leave their airship outside the city, and prepare the appropriate spells.
- Kaz casts Teleportation Circle, and they are whisked away to an underground stone room filled with piles of gold, precious gemstones, chests, and rare magic items. 
- After a moment, the team hears the sound of shifting gold coins. Stepping up over a pile on the other side of the room, a thin and respectable looking shifter woman wearing a monocle steps into the light. She smiles, cracks her neck, and informs the team they have made a grave mistake in attempting to steal from her. In a flash of speed, she vanishes and reappears behind the team, stabbing with a deadly-looking red kukri. The fight is on.
- This newcomer is faster than any enemy the team has ever encountered, moving at rapid speed almost faster than the eye can track. 
- Rising out of the piles of gold, a stone golem appears and joins the fray, sowing further chaos. The team is scattered, and each are frantically trying to pin down this speed demon that has descended upon them.
- After several tense rounds, and a few lucky hits, the group manages to land enough glancing blows on the blur that she stops abruptly and holds up her hands in a truce.
- The woman introduces herself as **Porkchop**, one of the legendary members of the Heroes of Harmstead, and old adventuring group that once saved Athendria. She comments on and respects the guts of the team to teleport into her private vault, and their ability to hold their own against her.
- The team apologizes, explaining that they were expecting a red dragon; Porkchop grimaces and states that she may have encouraged that rumor through illusion magic, and that she thought it would prevent people from trying to get their stuff back.
- Porkchop takes a liking to the group, and leads them out of her vault into her private office. She interviews them, and generously lets them take a small selection of items from her vault as a reward to being so entertaining.
- The team is barely holding together, so they ask to rest before going any further. Porkchop obliges, and promises to answer their questions the following morning.

### 9th of Nimbus:

- The Gang awakes within Porkchop's castle, in her private estates in a valley filled with grapevines. They speak with her further about their quest to find the location of the legendary **Tabor of Rhu'Darok**.
- Porkchop expresses her embarrassment, as she stole it from the collector originally, but she traded it with an acquaintance for some other magical artifacts she wanted. Upon further persuasion, she reveals this acquantiance to be known as **Abdiel Lutair**, a mysterious plane-jumper who once belonged to the same adventureing group as Duke Janos Dragonslayer.
- As a final gift as thanks for entertaining her, she sends to Abdiel and requests and audience on their behalf. After a short tour of her vineyards and a chance to feed her pet Griffon, the team is stunned by Abdiel's arrival, in which he steps through a planar rift onto the grass nearby.
- Abdiel has orange hair and eyes, with streaks of grey, and nondescript fine black robes. He greets them all, and upon being questioned, informs the party that he took the Tabor as a gift for his friend **Rhu'Darok**, in the realm of Elysium.
- After some confusion, the team comes to realize that Rhu'Darok is in fact dead, and Abdiel traveled to Elysium to gift the long-dead bard his favorite instrument from the realm of the living. Abdiel suggests that the team could travel there to ask the bard to borrow it in person, as only Rhu'Darok could gift it to them now.
- After a brief conversation, the group agrees to travel with Abdiel to the realm of Elysium, since the Tabor seems to be the only weapon that can possibly stand up against the growing Darkness.
- Abdiel agrees to this, and after a brief conversation with Porkchop, Plane Shifts the entire party to Elysium.

### 10th of Nimbus through the 15th of Nimbus:

- The party arrives in a dark, shadowy demiplane. Abdiel explains to them that to actually enter Elysium through these means, they will have to subject themselves to "judgement" by the Watcher. Kaz and Mittens decides to stay behind in the demiplane on this quest, as he in particular doubts that his pact with a devil will help with attempting to pass into the realm of Elysium. Ser, Dhamiria, and Zephyr continue forward with Abdiel.
- After a brief jolt, the party finds themselves in a long, seemingly endless gargantuan hallway lined with gigantic columns that rise from floor to ceiling. Clouds cluster around the ceiling, and the floor seems to be an endless highway of pristine, reflective marble. Abdiel is nowhere to be seen. After walking in one direction for some time, Dhamiria spots a distant fast moving object heading towards the party from far away down the hallway.
- As it gets closer and resolves, the team beholds the Watcher in all its heavenly and horrific glory. A lion-like beast with four sets of glowing wings, and a head covered in glowing eyes and wrapped in multiple rotating halos, it skids to a stop in front of the party, looming over them with a menacing and overwhelming aura.
- **The Watcher** asks of them, "Are You Worthy to enter Elysium?" Each party member steps forward, one at a time, and states their intention to meet with Rhu'Darok and return to Athendria to save the Olmothian Woods from the Darkness.
- Ser goes first, and after stating his intention with clarity and persuasiveness, the Watcher brings down its massive paw on his head, seemingly crushing him. As the paw lifts, no trace remains. Dhamiria is next, and she attempts to prove her worth with her courage and support of her friend. She too, is dispelled by the Watcher's paw. Zephyr goes last, and builds on her friends' claims, and winces as the paw descends upon her head.
- All three of the party find themselves standing in an unearthly beautiful courtyard, surrounding by shifting buildings and gardens. Ghost-like forms wander the space, seemingly in a state of bliss.
- Abdiel approaches, the only other solid person to be seen, and congratulates the party on getting past the Watcher. He agrees to take them to Rhu'Darok, and suggests they watch their manners while in the realm, lest the Guardians of the Holy Realm take note of any transgressions.
- The group follows Abdiel as he strolls through the celestial streets, and the group struggles to comprehend the shifting, reforming landscape as it adapts around them.
- Eventually, the group hears music on the air. A beautiful flute solo is being played perfectly. The group enters a majestic concert hall were hundreds of transluscent shades watch a singular performer play pristine music.
- As he finishes his concert, the shades applaud and disperse. Nameless walks the team over to the performer, and introduces them to the spirit of **Rhu'Darok** himself.
- The dead Ascendant is friendly enough, but seems distracted and hard to keep his focus. The party asks for his Tabor, but he is unwilling to part with it, as it was his favorite instrument in life. Dhamiria tries to lie about their reasons for wanting it, and the sky darkens as massive angelic guardians appear around the group; lying is not tolerated within Elysium, and the party delicately apologizes to avoid being destroyed. 
- Ser proposes a musical competition and invents a slapdash instrument with Zephyr's help to trade in exchange for "borrowing" the Tabor. Even though Rhu'Darok crushes them in the competition, his curiousity at their bizzare and haphazard instrument is enough to elict his generosity.
- The team is loaned the mystical Tabor as Rhu'Darok summons it from thin air, and they thank him and immediately prepare to leave. Nameless congratulates them on their success, before banishing them all back to Athendria. Kaz and Mittens join the group, and they all return to the familiar location of Drakkengrad.

### 16th of Nimbus through the 18th of Nimbus:

- Even though it only felt like a few hours in Elysium, the group has been absent from Athendria for a full week. Having acquired the Tabor, Ser is eager to return to the Olmothian Woods, but Zephyr insists they face Vivian and rescue her father. The group boards their airship and departs for Lysanor to confront Vivian face-to-face.

### 19th of Nimbus:

- After the short flight to Lysanor, the team parks their airship some distance away in the grasslands. They wait until the agreed upon time to approach the rendezvous, and then slowly approach the location on the road, their alert on high.
- Vivian appears on top of a hill, her helmet removed, with no sign of Zephyr's Dad.
- As she slowly descends, she keeps her face a careful mask of emotionless stoicism. As the party stops, and she faces them all down, she announces that she has come to make them pay for how they hurt her, and how they murdered her father.
- Ser and Zephyr try to reason with her, but she is unreachable. She states that the only way justice can be found, for them to pay for how they killed the Ox, is to make them feel the same loss.
- Her demeanor of calm shatters, and she throws herself in a fury at the party. As they dive into action, they plead and reason with her to try and talk her down, but it isn't enough. A violent fight ensues.
- Ser is hit with one of Vivian's strongest spells: feeblemind. Ser is rendered useless, and it looks unlikely that everyone will escape intact. However, in the last critical moments, Zephyr manages to blast Vivian down, knocking her unconcious.
- As Vivian falls, her suit activates a contingency, surrounding her body in a forcecage. As the team heals up and tries to figure out what to do, suddenly there is a flash as **Archmage Thariune** himself teleports nearby. He surrounds the party, flanked by a half-dozen of his Unseen troops.
- He dispels the forcecage and lifts Vivian, healing her before addressing the party. As she comes to, he slowly turns his attention to the group and tells them that Vivian is not to be harmed. As a peace offering, he removes the feeblemind curse on Ser.
- Vivian feebly attempts to protest and express her anger, but Thariune swiftly stops her with a firm and dangerous glance. He tells her to return Zephyr's father, and to be done with this petty revenge ploy.
- Vivian slowly opens a *Portable Hole,* and Harry, Zephyr's father crawls out. He is unharmed, but somewhat neglected. He mostly seems confused.
- Thariune turns back to the </br> party and tells them that the  </br> matter is settled. They  </br> are banned from entering </br> Lysanor, and must keep </br> their distance from Vivian. </br> He then turns to Vivian, </br> and they seem to engage </br> in some form of psychic </br> communication. She intially </br> seems to resist, but then bows </br> her head in supplication. </br> Thariune, Vivian, and the </br> Unseen teleport away, back to </br> the city, leaving the party </br> with Harry and a </br> free *Portable </br> Hole* in the </br> grasslands </br> outside </br> Lysanor.
