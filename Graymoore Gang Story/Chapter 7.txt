# Chapter 7 - Delving in the Dark

### 8th of Navar:

- Awakening to the still and cold cave, the team investigates the chamber. Dhamiria, recalling her earlier experience in the Sepulchre of the Raven Queen, decides to wade into the red liquid pool. She does, feeling the same surreal loss of sensation as the liquid meets her skin, but it doesn't grant any visions. Instead, she feels a wave of exhaustion, and barely pulls herself back out, feeling horribly drained.
- Distracted by her ordeal, Kaz barely notices strange spider-like eel creatures emerging from the large hole in the back of the cave. After a tense moment of confusion, they attack! The party leaps into action, hacking and slashing at a small swarm of the monsters. Kaz is overwhelmed by a bunch of the small ones, while Ser summons some magic goats to stampede them. The largest monster appears to be a spellcaster, and Zephyr finds herself being counterspelled by it. Ser is commanded magically to walk into the ravine, which he does immediately. Zephyr manages to feather fall him as he drops, while Dhamiria finishes off the larger monsters with her glaive.
- Zephyr follows Ser down into the ravine, and they investigate its depths. It drops some 800 feet or so, before arriving at a small cave littered with the bones of creatures that fell into it. They find a path that goes deeper underground, with a roughly carved signpost written in Undercommon, which Dhamiria knows. It reads "135 miles to Silh Unarith" and "215 miles to Gaelgaroth."
- The monsters are identified as *Neogi*, evil creatures that wander the Underdark enslaving all beasts they find. Reflecting on what they know and what they overheard from the Neogi leader, the team agrees that Dhamiria's Aunt must have come to perform the ritual but been abducted by a group of Neogi at the last second, pulling her into the Underdark.
- Using Fly and Feather Fall, Zephyr and Kaz escort the entire team, mounts and all, down into the ravine. Then, the proceed down into the tunnel, riding for hours into the depths of the Underdark. Eventually the determine it must be close to nighttime, so they make camp and sleep.

## **LEVEL UP (9)**

### 9th of Navar through the 15th of Navar:

- Over the following week, the team delves into the Underdark.
- They find some odd mushrooms growing on the cave walls and pick them. They have a variety of different effects, from providing light to being a reliable source of bland food.
- At one point, the team comes to a 3-pronged fork in the tunnels. Zephyr uses divination magic to decide that the left path is doom, so they take the right path.
- The team quickly runs out of food for their animals, so they begin to forage. They find a set of cart tracks in the rock and mud, tracks that match the cart tracks they found leading away from the Raven's Grotto.
- Ser eats some mushrooms that, while filling, force him to talk nonstop and have no filter on his thoughts. Everyone finds it thoroughly irritating.
- Ser later summons some giant spiders to forage for the team, since they are having a hard time finding food. They are successful, brining back a cave lizard and more mushrooms.
- Needing to feed the goats vegetable matter, they give them the remaining edible mushrooms, which also make them bleat like mad for the rest of the day.
- Kaz rediscovers the cart tracks, assuring them they are on the right path. 
- On the sixth day, Dhamiria feels called away from the group by a vision of her ancestors. She follows, and they direct her attention to a large encampment nearby on the shore of large subterranean lake. Zephyr uses *Arcane Eye* to spy on it from a distance, and they determine it is the home of the Neogi. There are dozens, maybe a hundred or so living there. She also sees several cages filled with captives of different varieties on the edge of the camp.

### 16th of Navar:

- After planning and resting, the team decides to capture a Neogi for interrogation.
- Kaz uses his psionic mind trick to get one away from the camp, while Dhamiria jumps on it. It screams, but Kaz uses Zehruut to distract the guards, and everyone escapes. 
- Ser uses Detect Thoughts while Dhamiria asks the Neogi questions. They learn that the Neogi sold Dhamiria's aunt to the dark elves living in the capital city of **Gaelgoroth,** about ten days ago.
- Learning more about the habits of the Neogi and their wants and needs, the team sends the captive back to his camp to try and barter for the remaining slaves.
- After some discussion and intimidation, the Neogi offer to sell the team all their slaves and four weapons in exchange for the *Decanter of Endless Water* and a huge pile of magically summoned food.
- The team feeds and heals the slaves, and gives them a speech to inspire them to help the team attack the Neogi, ending them once and for all. Sixteen of the freed slaves agree to go back and fight.

### 17th of Navar through the 18th of Navar:

- The following morning, the freed slaves and the gang prepares their plan of attack. They are also joined by a wandering half-orc druid named Kaiju, who wants to contribute and help heal the injured. He met Aunt Barraka briefly, sharing that she momentarily escaped her cage near the Ruins of Silh Unarith, but she was recaptured.
- The attack begins in a burst of fire, as Zephyr and Kazbiel rain fireballs down upon the Neogi encampment. In seconds, dozens of their structures burst into flames. The slavers are vulnerable to fire, and many of them rapidly perish. Mittens and Dhamiria dive into the fray, slashing left and right, while Ser uses plant growth to slow and hinder their escape. It is a slaughter, and in less than a minute the entire small village to reduced to ashes. A few survivors flee into the darkness.
- The victors loot the camp, collecting a few potions and a couple sets of *Haze Goggles*, which allow the wearer to see through the strange prismatic haze that is rumored to fill the caverns of some parts of the Underdark.
- After departing, Kaiju follows the party and shares some background. He is a member of the League of Blue Steel, and he got lost in the Underdark while hunting strange, corrupted crystalline creatures that have been appearing in the Olmothian Woods. He is also aware of the growing Darkness that Ser fears, and is seeking a solution.
- Later that day, the party is ambushed by a hunting pack of Gricks, but they roast them as well with Kaz's fire magic. Food reserves are running low, and everyone is hungry.
- The next morning, Kaiju identifies some ripplebark mushrooms for the party to feed on. The party learns of a region in the Underdark known as the Mycellium Wilds, where many of the underdark potions are derived from.

### 19th of Navar:

- The team arrives at **Gaelgaroth**, a massive drow city nestled in a cavern on the edge of the great underground lake.
- The group plans their entrance. Knowing the cultural significance of the Drow, Dhamiria pretends to be a slaver, with Kaz as her henchman and the rest as her captives. They climb into the caged wagon they stole from the Neogi camp. 
- Dhamiria presents herself to the guards of the city, and manages to lie her way past the front gate.
- The citizens of Gaelgaroth are exclusively drow, with a heavy female dominance. A few deep dwarves and gnomes are spotted here and there, but noone from the world above. A few of the drow have strange, half-drow, half-fiend servants with 4 arms that vaguely resemble gorillas.
- The team parks their wagon in a back alley, and splits up to investigate. Dhamiria and Kaz head to the center of the city, where a large colosseum containing a sand pit sits infront of a carved stone castle. Kaiju transforms into a bat and flys away to scout the area.
- Dhamiria and Kaz are granted entry, and rapidly learn that this is a coronation ceremoy. It appears to be a battle to the death, to determine the next Queen of the Underdark.
- After a quick and vicious battle of swords and magic, a young drow woman defeats her opponent, beheading the previous Queen. The crowd cheers, and she is crowned **Deepqueen Levray Thenorza, Lady of Gaelgaroth**.
- As more gladitorial-style combats ensue as entertainment, Kaz and Dhamiria decide to find out where her Aunt may be and make sure she isn't sent out into the arena.
- The team regroups, but Kaiju never returns. They decide to pose as a traveling menagerie, to get close to the guard barracks and investigate where Dhamiria's Aunt may have gone. 
- Zephyr is put into a dunking booth, while Ser plays music and Kaz provides special effects. Dhamiria leads the show. The performance is so successful, the guard captain asks Dhamiria to perform for the newly appointed Deepqueen. After some tactly investigation, seeking a new member to her traveling circus, Dhamiria learns of another weird drow with tattoos like herself that was recently moved away from Gaelgaroth, to the high security prison of the **Weaver's Perch.**
- With this new lead, the team leaves the city and moves to the edge of the lake. They lure two drow guards over and ambush them, using some Mind Manipulation magic from Ser to blur their memories of the capture and acquire information about the location of the Weaver's Perch. They trash their slaver's cart and leave the unconscious guards behind, all as cover for getting out of performing for the Deepqueen. One additional guard spots them, but is paralyzed by Zehruut's poison. They bring her with them, repeatedly paralyzing her until the next morning when Ser can mind wipe her as well. The poor guard has a rough night as Zehruut keeps stabbing her to keep her paralyzed.

### 20th of Navar:

- Overnight, Dhamiria dreams of her ancestors. They guide her, helping her to unlock the remaining potential of her ancestral skill to move within the shadows.
- Ser obliterates the remaining memories of the captured guard, and they toss her outside the city and flee.
- Wandering back into the maze of the Underdark, the team finally encounters some *Havoc Haze.* This region of the Underdark is filled with a shimmering, prismatic dim light that is disconcerting.
- The team rests before attempting to cross it the next day.

### 21st of Navar:

- Those who feel like they need it don the Haze Goggles they acquired from the Neogi Camp and push into the Haze. At first, nothing much happens.
- After wandering through it for some time, a gang of Umber Hulks and Hook Horrors attacks the party, forcing them to jump into action. Ser and Zephyr's magic distorts strangely, causing horrible side effects, which hit Kaz instead of their targets. Kaz's goat mount is murdered by a Hook Horror while he is distracted.
- Kaz attempts to hit the offending monster with an eldritch blast, but it instead summons an imp next to him, which attacks and knocks him unconscious.
- Dhamiria and Zephyr's summoned monsters finish off the beasts.
- Traveling deeper, Ser begins to exhibit signs of Haze Madness, becoming paranoid and seeing things.
- At the end of the day, they team pushes on and eventually exits the Haze. Zephyr scouts ahead magically and discovers **Rezbazon, the Weaver's Perch** is very close. It is a large, subterranean prison built into the ceiling of a massive cavern, filling and bridging multiple hanging stalactites. The entire structure is cocooned and swaddled with spider webs, keeping it secret.

### 22nd of Navar:

- The party wakes up and begins their plan to rescue Aunt Baraka. The group stealths across the open caven floor, and then uses magic to fly up to the northern edge of the prison and strike hard on a ballista outpost. After overpowering the two guards there, they continue deeper into the complex. Zehruut agrees to be a massive distraction, and takes the Deck of Illusions with him. He starts tossing cards all over the prison, and within moments there are dozens of powerful illusions flying about (dragons, giants, beholders and more). At the entrance to the jail cells, the team takes out the next gaurds with polymorph and a quick punch from Dhamiria. Using the guards' keys, they enter the jail cells. There, they find Aunt Baraka, as well as several other dangerous-looking criminals.
- At this moment, the warden of the prison, the **High Weaver**, emerges from her stalactite. With a burst of magic, she dispels the illusions and directs the guards to pursue the true interlopers. Zephyr briefly tries to hit her with some lightning, but it is rapidly countered. Seeing her match, she runs back to the party and urges them all to flee. Kaz tosses up magical darkness, while Zephyr tosses an Air Elemental into the mix. Everyone leaps from the edge of the prison and they feather fall to the cavern floor below.
- Zehruut flies ahead to bring the mounts over, and the team runs for a different exit tunnel. A ballista bolt from prison behind them comes streaking across the cavern, targeting the weakened Baraka. Kaz, without thinking, flings himself into its path. He is promptly impaled and stapled to the cavern floor, near death. Ser grabs him, and dimension doors them both off of the bolt and towards the mounts. He pours a healing potion into the gaping hole in Kaz's chest, which seems to stop the bleeding but will need further administrations to heal properly.
- Zephyr blasts the next ballista bolt out of the air with lightning as it streaks towards the party. With that last deflection, the group escapes into the tunnel, mounts their beasts, and rides away into the distant tunnels. Behind them, up on the cavern ceiling, the Weaver shouts out a promise of capture and vengeance after them as they flee.
- As they run, Ser places multiple castings of Plant Growth to overgrow and hinder their pursuers. 
- The team spends the rest of the day running at random through the Underdark, trying to put as much distance between them and their pursuers. While they go, Aunt Baraka tells her story to them, filling them in on the blanks in her struggles. She was captured before she could complete the ritual with the Coronet by the Neogi. At the ruins of Silh Unarith, she briefly escaped and used the Coronet to become invisible. She threw it into the ruins before the Neogi caught up with her, and she hopes it remains there still. She knew she couldn't let the Drow find it.
- With their new destination set, the team begins to seek their way through the Underdark, back towards the region where the ruins reside.

### 23th of Navar to the 26th of Navar:

- The escapees continue through the Underdark at a breakneck pace, trying to put as </br> much distance behind them. Ser </br> continues to cast Plant Growth to slow </br>their pursuers. After discussing how</br> to escape, they agree to take the </br>shortest path to the Ruins through the </br>*Silken Paths*, a region of the Underdark </br>completely coated in dense, massive spiderwebs.
- After arriving, they manage to convince a gnome riding on a spider-like creature to be their guide. He is expensive, and takes several magic items as payment. However, he promises a smooth transit, and they follow his directions to traverse the region.
- Despite the initial hesitation, the guide proves invaluable. His food caches and ability to avoid danger is a much-needed respite.
- Along the route, they are inconvenienced by more Havoc Haze and Darkmantles, but they persevere.
- Talking further, Aunt Baraka informs the team that the Coronet is far too powerful to let it fall into the hands of the Drow. It was known to command armies of undead, summon demons, mind control people, and turn people invisible. It is truly and artifact of pure evil.

### 27th of Navar to the 28th of Navar:

- The team finally exits the Silken Paths, and takes direction from their guide to the ruins of Silh Unarith. He takes his leave and the party proceeds on their way, scavenging food and mushrooms. 

### 1st of Nanook:

- Mittens goes hunting and finds a large crab, providing plenty of food for the short term. At the end of the day, the group finally arrives at a large cavern, where the ruins of Silh Unarith resides. Vague glowing lights reside below in the ruins, and the team descends the slope to find their way towards the center. Aunt Baraka recalls tossing the Coronet into the center of the cavern before being recaptured.

### 2nd of Nanook:

- Descending into the ruins, the party prepares to search for the Coronet. As they inspect the open rocky field where Aunt Baraka recalls leaving it, Mittens sense something stirring above, and growls. The party jumps into action as a massive, worm-like monstrosity flys towards them from the ceiling: a **Neothilid**. Its horrible, eyeless head whips around trying to find them, and in the fight that ensues, it manages to swallow Dhamiria whole. The entire party blasts it with magic, and Dhamiria manages to cut her way out before she is fully digested.
- Remarking on its strange size and alien physiology, the group continues deeper into the ruins. Zephy sends an earth elemental named *Borborygmus* ahead to scout for danger, and it warms them of traps, magical statues, and Driders in different areas of the ruins.
- They navigate around most of these obstacles. At one corner of the ruins, Dhamiria finds a statue wearing a **Cloak of Subtlety**, a purple cloak enchanted to provide protection in darkness and conceal the wearer.
- Ser and Zephyr decipher the contents of a carved mural, depicting a dragon that attacked the ruins many centuries ago, which the old drow who used to live here call **"Moorvuna the Voiceless One."**
- Heading deeper into the ruins, following the magical signature of the Coronet, the team arrives at a room filled with glowing purple pools of squirming tadpoles.
- They are attacked by three Mind Flayers, and barely escape the encounter. After, Kaz burns all the pools of tadpoles, destroying all chance of these Mind Flayers reproducing.
- A the end of this chamber, they find a mucuous-filled tunnel descending deeper, and embedded in the walls of slime, the ***Coronet***. They grab it, and flee the ruins, heading back into the tunnels of the underdark to seek the entrance back at the Raven's Grotto, hoping to escape the tribulations of the Underdark.

### 3rd of Nanook to the 17th of Nanook:

- Over the next several days, the party moves fast and heals from their troubles. Aunt Baraka expresses her fears about the Coronet, and the team each takes turns carrying it, hidden away, to keep its evil influence suppressed.
- The team encounters the occasional Underdark monster, but other than that, travel is quick. Food is sparse and the team is all very tired of eating foraged mushrooms.
- Then, unexpectedly, in a region of Haze, the team turns a corner and runs headlong into the **High Weaver**. The Warden had predicted their route, and had taken a different path around the Silken Paths to head them off here, close to the Raven's Grotto.
- After demanding the Coronet and Aunt Baraka be turned over, the Weaver attacked the group with her fellow elite guards. A quick and vicious battle later, Dhamiria finished off the dangerous drow with a swift stab of her halberd.
- Zephyr takes the Weaver's magic items, including her strange headpiece with spider-like visual elements. The best item she had is the *Corset of the Broodmother*, a magical corset that sprouts spider-like arms out of silk and grants the wearer the ability to climb on walls.
- The team pushes on. Several more days pass, but they eventually arrive back at the bottom of the pit in the Raven's Grotto. With some fly spells, the team levitates themselves out of the pit, arriving back in the cave at the top of the mountain.
- They rest and celebrate their escape from the Underdark. Aunt Baraka performs the sealing ceremony upon the Coronet by bathing it in the liquid of the red pool, suppressing its dark power for another year.

### 18th of Nanook to the 24th of Nanook:

- The party makes the return trek through the snowy Darkspire peaks towards Nyumbani. After half a week, they arrive back to much rejoicing. After a celebration, Aunt Baraka discusses with Dhamiria's mother and uncle about the fate of the village, and what to do with the Coronet.
- The village elders agree the Coronet is no longer safe to be kept in Nyumbani. At Dhamiria's suggestion, they agree to take it to Drakkengrad, where Aunt Baraka will explore options with the Deaconess at the Raven's Wing Sepulchre to find a more permanent, safe solution.
- The celebration is short-lived, as the party needs to return to Drakkengrad. The next morning, the team takes their leave of Nyumbani, and starts climbing down out of the mountains to travel to Leafside for teleportation.
- They travel through Murkwater, where Ser performs his newly written songs about the Greymoore Gang and their exploits, which are picked up by the locals. On their way across the Timberlands they stop in Xruul, an outpost to watch for invaders to the Midlands.
- They find more mossy ruins in the area near Leafside, and find some traces of Ascendant technology. Eventually, they make it back to Leafside, and use the teleportation there to return to Drakkengrad, after a brief discussion with Drakelord Rolar.
- At long last, the party returns to Drakkengrad, having completed their Underdark journey.
