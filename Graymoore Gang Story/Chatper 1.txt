# Chapter 1 - Graymoore

### 21st of Isoldre in the Year 1127

At a small, dingy inn on the shore of the *Bay of Denalas*, a bedraggled and soaking wet man stumbles through the creaky door. He sighs in relief to get inside out of the rain, and his faintly luminescent cerulean eyes glance around the oppressive room. A few halfings sit a table, quietly gambling, while the red dragonborn barkeep polishes a few glasses. A short human woman sits by the fire reading a book, and nearby a looming firbolg converses enthusiastically with a muscular dark elf woman at a table nearby. Satisfied, the man shakes out his cloak, and approaches the barkeep. 

"Welcome to the *Glowing Hearth Inn*!" booms the dragonborn. "My name is Kodrak; what's yours?." The wet man sits down and relaxes a bit, pushing his damp black hair out of his face and tucking it behind his pointed grey ears.

"I go by **Kaz**. Do you have food and lodging?" The dragonborn laughs and affirms that rooms and dinner are indeed available, and Kaz waits to be served. He examines the strangers gathered in the room once again, listening to their conversations.

"It really is a small world!" booms the red-haired firbolg man to the dark elf, who smiles. "Last time we met was what, 20 years ago?"

The woman nods and replies, "It must be fate, to cross paths again. I'm glad to see you're doing well, and I hope your family is too."

This reply seems to sober the firbolg somewhat, and he shrugs. "My family is alright; the forest is getting weird though. There is a *Darkness* in the forest that is spreading, and I'm here seeking answers. I have no idea what's wrong, but the elders in Oakheart don't seem to consider it a big enough issue to call for aid."

At this time, the dragonborn brings out several plates of food for all the customers. Kaz is served at the bar, while the rest are handed plates. Kaz, not wanting to remain distant, wanders over to the table, and asks, "Mind if I join you?"

The two strangers lean back and nod politely, and Kaz sits with them. "The name is Kaz; do you know each other?" The firbolg laughs and smiles genially, stroking his bushy red beard and saying "Welcome Kaz! My name is **Ser**, and this is my very old acquaintance **Dhamiria**. We met long ago, when I was still a child, while traveling with my family in the *Darkspire Mountains* to trade."

Dhamiria smiles politely at Kaz, while he tries not to feel intimidated by her impressive physique, braided and beaded white hair and imposing tattoos scrawled across her exposed upper arm. A simple glaive ornamented with a raven's feather sits propped against the back of her chair. She grabs a thick and crusty loaf of bread and rips it in half with casual ease.

As the three of them make small talk and discuss the state of the roads, a sudden shudder runs through the room. A trembling rattles up from deep below, and dust showers down from the ceiling. Half of the people in the tavern jump up in a panic, but the dragonborn inkeep yells out, "No worries! Its just another tremor, it'll pass in a moment."

Indeed, the shaking subsides after only a moment. The human woman previously standing by the fireplace is now standing, staring at the floor in fascination. She whips around to face the three newcomers also standing with a discerning gaze and states "Did any of you see any big fissures or cracks on the road on the way in?"

Kaz shakes his head no, as do the others. The woman joins the people at the table and sits down, tossing her long orange scarf over her should and shaking her brown curls out of her face. She seems excited by the event, and dives into conversation with the rest, questioning the earthquake's origin, and apparently fully acquainted with their names from eavesdropping from the fire.

Dhamiria stops her as she rambles off rhetorical questions about tectonic plates and magical leylines and asks "It seems like you know our names; what did you say yours was?"

The woman blinks her green eyes in surprise and then smiles, declaring "My apologies! I've gotten carried away; my name is **Zephyr**, wizard extraordinaire and aeromancy enthusiast. So, as I was saying..."

As the night wears on, the four travelers talk about their travels, discuss their plans for the near future, and get to know each other. They enjoy herbal tea around the fire, quickly become friends. As they inspect a job posting board, they agree to collaborate on a few tasks the next couple days to earn some coin.

### 22nd of Isoldre:

* The next morning, the four travelers awake and greet each other in the tavern. They inspect the job postings once again and head out into the town to seek employment.
* Three jobs seemed the most interesting: guard duty for an archaeologist, pest control for the stablemaster, a lost dog, and gathering wheat from the fields.
* Occassional tremors rock the earth around them still, keeping everyone on edge.
* Just as the players leave the tavern, a crazed man busts through the door and attacks Zephyr. She managed to levitate him before he did any serious damage, and Kaz knocked him out.
* The players take the man to the town lawman, a dwarven man known as **Constable Broderick Gray**. He jails the crazed man and puzzles over where he came from. His grandfather was the founder of Graymoore.
* More earthquakes trouble the town. The travelers visit **Stablemaster Thrulda** seeking payment, and learn about giant bugs that have dug a tunnel beneath her stable and stolen a couple of her horses.
* The four descended into the tunnels to see if the horses could be rescued. In the dug tunnels below, various cave-dwelling monsters harried them, hurting them badly and forcing them to flee back to the surface.
* There, they inspected the Stablemaster's mounts for sale, which included antelope-like mounts and a juvenile moorebounder, a rare and aggressive cat-like mount. Ser and Dhamiria both seemed intrigued by the moorebounder.
* Returning to the inn, they encountered **Kelly Seekerton**, the archaeologist returning from her current expedition to the tavern. She is thin and pale with a bowl cut and comically thick glasses. She is a traveling archivist for the *Halls of Antiquity*, located in the distant city of *Vexyll's Pit*.
* Her last escort service went missing during an expedition. Undeterred, the travelers agree to travel with Kelly back to her dig site. A couple hours of travel away, they follow Kelly to a cave entrance, where she has a magical drill.
* Following Kelly into the cave with her drill, she leds them past mysterious ruins and motifs until she finds a spot to resume her drilling.
* She breaks through the wall and tells the four to wait behind, but suddenly a horde of horrible Kruthiks appear from the darkness, seeking the intruders. The travelers dove into the narrow tunnel and used illusion magic to mask their escape.
* This tenuous disception held long enough for Kelly to quickly teleported them all away to safety.
* The group arrived on a ruined battlefield, in a distant land in a region known as the *Balmere Plateau*. Kelly apologized that her aim was off, and she would bring them back to Graymoore in the morning.

### 23rd of Isoldre:

* After sleeping out in the open on the desolate plains, they woke and returned to Graymoore through Kelly's teleportation.
* In Graymoore it was raining torrentially, so Kelly paid the travelers for their trouble and encouraged them to rest.

## **LEVEL UP (2)**

* After the rain subsided, they four decided to go earn some money by harvesting wheat in the fields.
* Zephyr used her magic to summon multiple invisible servants to do the work for her, while the others labored away manually. She named her servant **Invisibelle**.
* After several hours of harvesting, the four were beset upon by two more crazed and ragged individuals. Zephyr thunderwaved them to death, but Kaz was knocked unconscious and was healed by Ser's magic.
* The Constable thanked them once again for their help and paid them to bury the bodies outside of town. They carried them there as it began to rain again, and Dhamiria said some words over the gravesite.
* After doing this, the players returned to town to the scene of a fourth crazy vagabond (this one a teenage girl) who had attacked the local dockmaster.
* Talking it over with the Constable, they determined that these individuals must have been arriving from the direction of **Leafside**, the major city to the south, and that they were wearing scraps of cloth made from silk from the coast to the northeast.
* They returned to the tavern to rest and spend some of their gold, discussing the implications of these strange vagabonds.

### 24th of Isoldre:

* After deliberating, the group decided to return to the tunnels beneath the stables. Making greater progress this time, they fought past several giant spiders and collected a fine silver dagger buried in the dirt.
* At the end of the tunnels, they found the corpse of a dog, which had been advertised as missing on the job posting board. 
* The team was attacked by more Kruthiks, so they crawled back to the surface to rest after the encounter. Then, they dove back down, and made it to the end of the tunnels.
* The missing horses were bound in silken cocoons, where larvae had been deposited. The group smashed the larvae and explored a little further, into a massive network of dug tunnels that seemed to stretch forever beneath the village.
* They returned to the surface, sealing the tunnel behind them. They collected pay from the stablemaster, and returned the body of the dog to **Ms. Lynn Wares**, the general store owner who had a few children. She was sad, but thanked them and traded basic supplies.
* They then visited **Blacksmith Dorru**, a stout halfling man, for repairs and upgrades.
* Ser and Dhamirira returned to the stables to try and build up a relationship with the Moorebounder, feeding it snacks and trying to become its friend.
* That night, the Constable asked the party to assist in guarding the town in case any more vagabonds showed up. They agreed to help.
* As Dhamiria was walking around the perimeter, she was attacked by a crazed dragonborn. She managed to defeat the man, and upon inspecting the body she found tattoos of a ship named the *Catalina*. **Dockmaster Rita**, the middle-aged woman in charge of the boats in town, identified this as a merchant vessel located in **Seabend**. 
* With this information, the group began to piece together that these vagabonds seem to be originating from the coast to the northwest, perhaps Seabend. Nothing further occurred that night.

### 25th of Isoldre:

* That morning, the Constable relaying information received from Leafside that the vagabonds are being called **Hollows**, as they seem to retain nothing of their former humanity. They are a plague across the Midlands, and are attacking people everywhere.
* Kelly Seekerton recovered from the previous trip, and asked for help again. Zephyr demanded more information before helping again, and she revealed that she was investigating ancient civilizations, and that she had an ancient artifact, which she showed them briefly to be a strange spiky polyhedral object.
* The group left town with Kelly, but not before stopping to feed the moorebounder again.
* The arrived at the caves and proceeded to make a sweep of a different series of passages. The group was attacked by Darkmantles and struggled to fight them off in the magical darkness they summoned.
* Eventually they unearthed a hidden passage. Beyond it, a sealed series of rooms included a guardian statue, various corpses, an ornate fountain and some chests.
* There, they looted various objects and spell scrolls while Zephyr recorded the arcane code for the teleportation sigil.
* The bodies were strange, appearing to belong to a race not currently known. Signage on the walls, in an unknown language similar to elven and dwarvish, translated to *"For the Glory of Dhanbaduhr."* Based on Kelly's guess, these ruins are over 1400 years old.
* The fountain was detected to contain magic, so the group spent several hours trying different approaches to open the brass flower bulb at its center. Kelly shared that sacrifice was a key tenet of these ancient people's culture, so Dhamiria and Kaz used fire magic to hurt each other while standing in the fountain.
* This worked, opening to reveal a brass armillary sphere inscribed with various spells. Zephyr snapped this up immediately, and learned it contains multiple divination spells.
* Leaving that branch of tunnels, the group returned to the previous dig site of a few days ago. Along the way, they found a chest, which turned out to be a mimic.
* Approaching the previous location, they were beset by more Kruthiks, one of which was the size of a car. Kelly pulled out an arcane gun and held her own as the group fought back. They barely managed to push through, and continued to the tunnel that Kelly had carved out previously.
* Within the room beyond the tunnel, Kelly grew secretive. Ser convinced her to let him help, so together they descended into a large chamber filled with fallen rocks and rubble.
* Ser found some runes but struggled to decipher them, taking note of mention of a *"Herrkivindi"*, and general instructions of *“Upon recharge, deposit the quintessihedron...”*
* Kelly thanked Ser for this, and told him to meet her at Vexyll's Pit if they get the chance. Dismissed, the group left Kelly to her own devices in the dark, ominous room and headed back to the surface.
* As they walked back to the surface, the ground began to tremble. Rocks fell from the ceiling as the tunnels and ancient ruins fell around them.
* A rock fell on Kaz's leg, pinning him, but Dhamiria and Ser lifted it off him and pulled him to safety. The team burst out of the opening just as it collapsed behind them.
* As they ran back towards town, a massive fissure split open the earth. Rocks and shrapel rained down around them. Kaz was hit again an fell unconcious, but was healed by Ser's magic ointment.
* Eventually the rumbling stopped, and the group staggered back to the tavern, explaining what had happened to the innkeeper, and went to sleep.
* Zephyr was too excited to sleep, examining the armillary sphere and learning how it worked. It is an ancient wizard spellbook, with various divination magic contained within. A breeze blew in her window, and she was compelled to go outside. There, she say framed in the moonlight, a floating city in the clouds. Awestruck, she started until it glimmered and faded from sight. She vowed to find it one day.
* In Kaz's private room, the fire in the hearth flares up, burning a bright blue. It forms the shape of a mouth, and speaks to him, offering him more power, saying that he has potential. Kaz accepts this free gift, and a purplish pseudodragon crawls out of the fire. Kaz names the familiar **Zehruut**, and quickly learns of his love of hard alcohol.
* Ser sleeps, but dreams of home. In his dream, he stands on the balconey, looking out at the forest. Elder Hammond asks what he will do next, and Ser replies that he doesn't know. Suddenly, a darkness is crawling over the treetops, approaching Ser and crowding down on him, all alone. Ser closes his eyes and plays a song, which seems to dispel the darkness. He spends the rest of his dream sitting on a riverbank, enjoying the calm.
* Dhamiria also has a dream of home, but she dreams of the frosty peaks of the Darkspire Mountains. A giant raven lands nearby, beckoning her to follow. She does, and it takes her to the peak of the nearby mountain, where she finds a drum. She plays it, and witnesses as a multitude of ghostly figures appear, the closest one resembling her grandmother. They speak to her and swear to protect her on her journey. Her dream falls into quiet rest, feeling strangely comforted.
 
## **LEVEL UP (3)**

### 26th of Isoldre:

* That morning, the ground groggily ate breakfast in the tavern. Everyone was surprise to meet Zehruut, Kaz's new pseudodragon familiar.
* Shouts from outside draw them to the docks, where a strange mass is sighted floating in the bay. Using a telescope, they group sees a figure riding upon it, as it moves away, deeper out into the ocean.
* The figure doesn't resemble Kelly Seekerton, but it does seem to be holding one of her bags.
* Ser tried to convince some sea turtles to give chase, but only a single land turtle replied to his call.
* The floating mass with unknown rider floated away into the sunrise. Confused, the group turned their attention back to gainful employment.
* They agreed to help build a fence around Graymoore to defend against the Hollows wandering the region. They spent the day working on the fence.
* Dhamiria and Ser spent time bribing the Moorebounder with meat, and agreed to call him **Mittens**. They had essentially decided to buy Mittens, but were holding out until the beast liked them more.

### 27th of Isoldre:
* They slept at the inn and awoke the next day to complete the fence. Taking breaks, the team sold off various odds and ends they had found in the caves and ruins.
* Dhamiria and Ser finally bought Mittens. The Stablemaster gave them riding gear and let them both take test rides, which went relatively smoothly. Zephyr and Kaz also bought horse steeds of their own, as did Ser. They were named **Borasco**, **Shrew**, and **Merlot**.
* That night, a horrid wave of *Hollows* assaulted the village out of nowhere. Ser was on watch, and he frantically called for help while trying to blast them back with all the thunder magic he had.
* As the sleeping members rose and ran to help, Kaz sprouted inky black wings, which seemed to burn blue at the edges, and he flew to Ser's aid. Zephyr magically enlarged Dhamiria, and she crushed the Hollows with her glaive.
* Ser was overwhelmed by the Hollows climbing the fence and was knocked unconcious, but the remainder were eventually slain by the team and Ser was rescued.
* The constable thanked them, and paid them in gold coins and whiskey as thanks. He remarked on the increasing danger from the Hollows, and begged the team to travel to **Leafside** to seek aid from **Drakelord Rolar**, and old friend of his. They agreed to make the journey, before they limped off to bed, and slept until morning.

### 28th of Isoldre:

* That morning the team gathered up supplies, bought a map, and met with Constable Graymoore one last time. He gave them rations for the trip, and asked them to stop by the house of **Old Fenrick**, who he hadn't visited in awhile, on the way.
* On the way out of town, the team passed by more fissures in the ground that seemed to have been related to the earthquakes from the days before. Dead kruthiks were scattered everywhere, damaged from the quake.
* One massive kruthik had survived, and attacked the group as they were riding. It gave chase, but the team leaped over a fissure, and Ser and Zephyr blasted it back with thunderwave as it jumped, knocking it down into the fissure below.
* They traveled to the edge of the Timberlands, and made camp near the treeline. Kaz spent awhile talking with Zehruut, and Dhamiria spent time teaching Mittens how to respond to commands and hunt for food.

### 1st of Ahwa:

* Dhamiria and Mittens hunted a boar in the morning; Dhamiria fell off in the process.
* The team traveled along the road, enjoying the summertime weather in the tall oak forest. At the end of the day, Ser summoned forth soup for the team to eat.

### 2nd of Ahwa:

* While traveling the road, the group encountered an offshoot road with a cabin at the end of it. The cabin was beset by Hollows, so they jumped in to help. Mittens held his own against the monsters.
* After dealing with the Hollows, an old half-orc man came out to speak with him. He was Old Fenrick, the friend of the Constable.
* Stopping to visit, they delivered the package to Fenrick, which he identified as hard liquor. Strangely, Fenrick also had a pet magic book named Bookvar. The floating boat was able to transform itself into various forms, such as a goat.
* Fenrick served them goat cheese pizza (cheese courtesy of Bookvar). Zephyr stared into goat-Bookvar's eyes and heard some strange chanting. She broke off the contact and the group excused themselves, bewildered by the strange encounter.
* After traveling the rest of the day, they made camp next to some broken stones identified as **Mosstop Ruins** on the map.

### 3rd of Ahwa:

* While keeping watch overnight, Ser witnessed a woman walking through the stones of the nearby ruins. In the morning, the team explored the ruins. Kaz detected a chest with Zehruut's help, and they began to excavate it.
* Unexpectedly, a strange woman with massively long ears appeared and walks through the space. Ser tries to speak with her, and she insisted upon "watering the crops in the garden." Ser did this task, and she then led to a buried chest containing a handy haversack before evaporating before their eyes, clearly some form of ghost.
* Zephyr opened the sack, digging around for goodies, but it was oddly empty.
* They made their way along the path for the remainder of the day before making camp along the roadside.

### 4th of Ahwa:

* Early in the morning the group encountered a family of ogres arguing in the road. They were planning on how to eat a young dwarf.
* The team ran in and used magic to convince the ogres that the smallest of them was planning to steal the dwarf for himself.
* In the ensuing chaos, Ser and Zephyr use illusion magic to further confuse the ogres, as Dhamiria saved the dwarven teenager from their grasp.
* The ogres are defeated, and the dwarf leads them to her family down the road, who were just arriving to rescue her. Making fast friends, the dwarves offer shelter and food as thanks.
* The dwarven clan is known as **The Chrome Shamans**, and are led by **Chief Orvig**. He feeds the group, and offers them intense spices.
* He advises them to keep an eye out for an older white-haired dwarf named **Old Silverhands**, a revered local legend for them.
* This legendary figure has been seen all the way east and west on the continent, and appeared to those who need help. The chromed silver paint that they wear on their faces is meant as a gesture of good will to him.
* Their last piece of advice is to seek out the **Bladewitches**, secretive magic users in the Olmothian Woods who may have insight into the *Darkness* of Ser's homeland. They are known for their distinctive double-sided polearms.
* That night, Zephyr wakes and sees the haversack move slightly, as a long dark hand, then arm, reaches slowly up out of the bag. A shoulder follows, and something starts climbing out of the bag.
* Zephyr jolts awake, and all seems well.

### 5th of Ahwa:

* Traveling with the dwarves, they approach Leafside. Everyone could smell burning bodies. As they exited the Timberlands and saw the tall walls of Leafside, they also saw the burning mounds of bodies outside the walls.
* As they passed the piles, they saw from their clothes and appearance that all the corpses were Hollows. Near the front gate, riders in blue plate rode out on the backs of **Blue Drakes**, rhino-like lizard mounts, to inspect them.
* Seeing that the group were not Hollows, the guards let them in. The team has arrived at Leafside!
* Entering through the gates, the team see the city of Leafside sprawling ahead of them. Ser spots a firbolg, and quickly strikes up a conversation. The nice man suggests they go to the Cerulean Garrison with the news from Graymoore, and to meet him for dinner at the Stone Kayak.
* They travel to the Garrison and are granted an audience with **Drakelord Rolar**, an intimidating firbolg woman with an eyepatch and serious demeanour.
* She is concerned about Graymoore, but explains that she is stretched thin dealing with several issues around Leafside.
* She shares that the Hollows are coming from the East, probably the city of Laudron. 
* A trade baron named **Molgar Darkbrow** is anxious to resolve the issue to resume inter-city trade.
* A goblin menance known as the **Re-Emboweler** has been attacking Hollows and citizens alike.
* Incessant clattering has been keeping everyone awake at night, and it seems to be emenating from the ruins at the center of the Lake. No expedition has been able to pinpoint the source yet, and its irritating everyone.
* The general gossip is that Hollows are just normal people that have somehow been brainwashed and let loose on the Midlands.
* The town drunk, **Tormod McLeary**, is often in touch with rumors, and loiters around the center of town. Bring him drink, and he will talk.
* With all of these leads, the team promises to lend aid to Drakelord Rolar, freeing up some of her guard so that she can send them to Graymoore. She thanks them, and the team leaves to have dinner.
* After a nice dinner with the firbolg, they are approached by two imposing individuals, who introduce themselves as **Soliana** and **Otis**. They belong to the **Order of the Grasping Fist**, and ask the team to keep their eyes peeled for a gnome with a purple mohawk, named **Vorros**.
* Apparently, the **Choice Cuts Corporation** (**CCC**), a banking firm with a branch in town, has a bounty out for this gnome.
* The pair suggest the gnome is disguised with a magic hat. They offered the group money in exchange for any leads about his location.
* That night, as the group went to sleep, more horrific, twisted shapes began to crawl out of the hander haversack. Zephyr felt paralyzed, and was barely able to wake up before the creature crawled out.

## **LEVEL UP (4)**
