# Chapter 6 - Across Athendria

### 20th of Sevana:

- Having defeated the Ox and settled the ongoing issues in the Midlands, the Graymoore Gang agrees to travel away on a new adventure.
- The team headed to the Order of the Grasping Fist to join them on their airship, the *Rapacious Raptor*. The ship is crewed by a collection of mercenaries from the Wind Trade Union, as well as the Order of the Grasping Fist. Seliana Dragonslayer is along for the journey, overseeing operations, and Otis joins as well.
- The group meets the ship captain, a hairy tiefling man named Captain Sadler Rutland, and a few others of his crew: a massive werebear cook named Wilt Brownleaf, and a halfling man named Shag Wenchum, the ship engineer.
- The ship departs Drakkengrad for a two week journey to the southern edge of Ebrea.
- Zephyr spends an extensive part of the journey learning from Shag about how airship engines work.

### 21st of Sevana to the 25th of Sevana:

- Dhamiria studies her manual of bodily health, while Kaz and Ser socialize with the crew members, holding a small party one night, with pizza.
- Otis and Dhamiria arm wrestle, and Dhamiria narrowly wins.

### 26th of Sevana:
- The airship is cruising some 50 feet over the ocean while Order members are fishing from the stern. Mittens and Gnasher play a game of soccer/fetch on the deck, and all is well.
- Kaz joins the Order for a fishing session, something he has never done before. It doesn't go well.

### 27th of Sevana to the 6th of Sirius:
- Many days pass as the team soars over the ocean.
- On a foggy night, Ser spots some odd balloon-like contraption off the port side of the airship. After some quick investigation, it appears to be a ballon filled with Kobold pirates!
- Everyone dives into action to defend the ship. Some of the kobolds possess wings, and they fly and land on the ship. A short but violent scuffle later, one kobold remains and is taken captive.
- He explains that they were seeking a quick way to find food, as his friends were attacked by some kind of scary flying monster. 

### 7th of Sirius:
- The lookout spots land! Ebrea arrives, and the crew prepares for arrival. The kobold is named Ulrich, and Zephyr convinces him to eventually join her on a future crew on her future airship. He agrees and is released back to his tribe in the jungles of Ebrea.
- In the distance, the lookout spots a derelict airship, floating adrift in the mountains. The party investigates, and finds evidence of strangle marks on the deck. The cargo, with the exception of the food, is untouched. There are no traces of the crew.
- A second airship is spotted floating alone, and the *Rapacious Raptor* approaches. The team climbs onto its deck, but can't find much going on. Ser casts Detect Thoughts to attempt to find survivors, and instead, detects the thoughts on the ship below him... 
- The entire vessel is not in fact a ship, but a gargantuan mimic abomination. It spreads its horrible wings, sprouts tentacles from the deck, and takes flight with the team on its back.
- Kaz and Dhamiria dive into action, stabbing at its eyes and gaping maw. Dhamiria is snatched by a stray tentacle and flung into its mouth, where she is crunched up in its gnashing molars. She barely cut her way back out into the open air.
- Kaz throws a fireball into its mouth, forcing it to close its maw. Ser and Zehruut attack the eyeballs with claws and magic, while Zephyr teleports madly about, trying to avoid being grabbed.
- Zephyr jumps off the side and floats to safety on the rocks below, blasting the monster with lightning as she descends.
- Ser, going all in, summons a flock of Axebeaks onto the deck which slash and peck at the mimic airship.
- As the monstrosity begins to thrash in the air, Dhamiria lands the final blow by plunging her glaive deep into the deck and running along its length, ripping wide a massive slash. The mimic ship lurches towards the ground, and Zephyr catches the rest of the crew with her magic as they leap from its deck and fall gently to the ground.
- The mimic airship crashes into the mountainside, and a flock of mephits descend upon its corpse to feed.
- Kaz recalls that mimics should never grow that large, and this must be a very rare exception.
- Returning to their airship, our heroes continue the search for wrecked airships, predicting that the mimic must have been feeding upon the trade vessels while they sailing through these mountain peaks.
- The team found another derelict airship. Cautiously, the crew fires their ballista into the side of it to be sure it wasn't also alive. It wasn't, so the team jumped down to the deck and recovered the remaining cargo.
- Zephyr snuck a spell scroll of "Murder of Crows" out of a chest in the ruined ship and scribed it into her spellbook back in her cabin.
- A third shipwreck is found wedged between two mountain peaks. The group falls down to its deck from above using feather fall, and investigated. Dhamiria pilfers some **Finder's Goggles**, and the team recovers a sealed chest that seems important to the Grasping Fist. Ser falls from the deck, but Zephyr catches him with more feather fall.
- As the Rapacious Raptor departed from the wreck, the deck is attacked by a swarm of Perytons: horrifying bird-beast-elk hybrids. Drawn by the hubbub, mephits descend onto the deck as well to attack the heroes. The captain morphed into his werewolf form, surprising the team, before shouting out orders to repel the attackers.
- A minute later, after a lot of magic and Ser polymorphing into a giant ape, the team slayed all the beasts. A Dire Peryton put up a tremendous fight, knocking down Otis and Soliana in the chaos, but was eventually slain by Dhamiria teleporting onto his back and beheading the monster.
- Zephyr collaborated with the ship's engineer to preserve the head of the Dire Peryton, and keep it as a trophy. Soliana thanked them all for their indispensable help, and gave them a gold bonus as a reward.
- As the day draws to a close, the expedition discovered a yacht-class airship, snagged on a tree. This one had an intact crsytal, and is an appealing option for the Gang to claim as their bounty for providing aid.
- The team completes their investigation, gathering up all the salvage and towing the two intact airships. After discussing with the captain, the team decided to claim the yacht-class airship as their reward.

### 8th of Sirius:

- The next day, Kaz and Ser convince the crew of the Raptor to aid them in repairing the found airship on the return journey. Zephyr spends time with the ship engineer, learning how to repair and run an airship engine.
- Ser formulates a new ballad about the adventures of the crew fighting the Perytons and the Mimic Airship. The team begins working on the salvaged ship, preparing it for travel. They agree they need to help Dhamiria's aunt as soon as possible, and arrange with the captain to be dropped off in the Darkspire Mountains on their way back to Drakkengrad.

### 9th of Sirius to the 27th of Sirius:

- On the return journey back to Ikesh, the team all contributes to the ongoing repairs of their new airship, which they christen the **Perilous Peryton**. Zephyr mounts the stuffed Dire Peryton head to the front of the airship as a figurehead.
- Finally arriving at the drop-off location, the Raptor dropped off the team at the base of the mountains in a grassy field, just south of the town of Murkwater. The team waved goodbye to the Raptor and their airship as the flotilla flew away, heading to Drakkengrad for repairs.
- The team begins their journey across the grassland towards the nearby Darkspires, once again intending to climb into its peaks in search of Dhamiria's ancestral home.

### 28th of Sirius to the 2nd of Navar:

- The team travels into the mountains over the following days. The seasons transition away from fall and into winter. Dhamiria guides the way through the mountains, seeking the tallest peaks in the distance where she knows her home lies.
- As the team goes higher, snow and ice form around them. With Dhamiria's permission, Ser speaks with a raven to send word ahead to the village that they are coming.
- Dhamiria sees her favorite mountain, Whitecrest Summit, appear on the horizon. While they head towards it, the team pauses to watch a rare, albino moorbounder cross a nearby hill. The team gives it a wide berth, and continues on their way.

### 3rd of Navar:

- As the sun lowers to the tops of the mountains, the team finally arrives at **Nyumbani**, the ancestral village in the snowy mountaintops, and home to the **Kubiri** people.
- Since the raven was sent ahead, the team is greeted by **Safiri**, Dhamiria's mother. They tearfully reunite, after Dhamiria's months traveling beyond the boundaries of her home where she was raised.
- The Kubiri people are generally suspicious of the others, and all outsiders in general. Dhamiria's Uncle, a stout drow named **Uso**, welcomes them in and declares a feast must be held.
- The Kubiri warm up towards the team as they enjoy a meal together around a raging bonfire. Dhamiria brings her family up to speed on all the travels her and the team have undergone together.
- After the feast, as the party and their mounts are housed and put to rest, Dhamiria goes away with her mother and uncle to talk of more serious matters. She learns that her Aunt, **Barraka**, the leader of their tribe, undergoes a yearly pilgrimage into the mountains to renew a pact with the **Raven Queen** at a spring of red liquid in a cave. This renewall is a vow to reinforce the Kubiri's resolve and emphasize their departure from the evils of the Crawling Queen, **Lolth**, and the Underdark.
- The most important act of this ritual is bathing an ancient relic in the red pool, protected by the leader of the Kubiri. This relic is known as **The Coronet of Lolth**.

### 4th of Navar:

- The team rests in the local hot springs to recover from their journey and begin planning for what comes next. Dhamiria attempts to use the Finders Goggles on some of Aunt Barraka's things to try and track her, but the trail is too cold.
- That evening, in celebration of the changing of the seasons, the Kubiri hold an ice skating race on the frozen lake in the center of the village. Kaz and Ser fail to keep up, but Zephyr and Dhamiria race neck and neck for the finish line (Zephyr abusing every magical advantage she could along the way).
- Despite Zephyr's efforts, Dhamiria wins regardless due to her superior skill. Zephyr's efforts do win her some favor with the Kubiri, as they respect her speed on the ice.
- Kaz heals a sick child with his magic, and Ser casts plant growth to enrich the crops of the Kubiri through winter. These gestures firmly remove any remaining suspicion of the party amongst the Kubiri people.
- That night, Dhamiria is trained by her Uncle Uso in the secret skill of her people, the ability to teleport and manifest shadow magic to protect her from harm. It takes her several tries, but she pushes through her boundaries and succeeds.

### 5th of Navar:

- The team prepares to leave Nyumbani to travel to the last known location of Aunt Barraka: the shrine with a red pool in the mountains. Safiri gifts the party two giant goats as mounts, since the horse Borasco and the lizard Snecko are poorly suited for the cold climate and rocky terrain. The animals stay behind in the village.
- The party departs Nyumbani, riding on Mittens, Gnasher, and the two goats. They leave the village by way of the open-air burial grounds for the Kubiri. Even though the others are creeped out, Dhamiria feels encouraged to see her ancestors laid out in the wind and snow, guarding her village.
- The team travels into the thick snow and rocky crevices of the mountains beyond Nyumbani. They make slow progress, and spend the night inside the protective magics of Ser's *Tiny Hut.*

### 6th of Navar:

- Progress is slow, as precarious ledges and icy paths present difficult traversal to the team. They near a small valley, and Dhamiria notes the presence of large mole-hill like holes scattered across it. Drawing from her people's folklore, she identifies the region as the lair of a *Remorhaz*, a deadly burrowing predator known for its scalding hot chitinous plates and ferocious appetite.
- To protect the village, the team agrees to ambush the beast. Ser uses plant growth the fill the area with vines and throns, while Kaz summons a glowing zone of hideous, sickening radiance to exhaust it.
- The Remorhaz burrows around most of the preventative measures, and attacks. Kaz and Dhamiria are caught up in the thick of it, both being burned badly by its thrashing, steaming body. Zephyr finishes the beast off with a well-placed lightning bolt, and the team harvests some heat-resistant skin from the monster after it cools off in the snow.
- Moving on, the team copes with a blizzard as it sets in. Gnasher sets off an avalanche by accident, requiring Ser to dimension door them both to safety, as the rest sprint for safety or cast fly to escape.
- The team gratefully rests early, escaping to the comfort of the Tiny Hut.

### 7th of Navar:

- Kaz begins to develop frostbite as the team progresses. Dhamiria begins to get turned around, as the mountains here are foreign to her. A pack of winter wolves begins to stalk the party, but they manage to evade them.
- After pushing on until sunset, the team finally arrives at their destination. Atop a mountain peak, and small cave entrance provides an escape from the bitter cold. A frozen stone statue of a Raven sits guard over the cave mouth, marking its significance.
- The team enters and tries to get warm. Inside, there are simple tile floors and a walkway down into a larger cavern. There, a small pond sits, where a small waterfall of ruby red viscous liquid pours into the pool from a crack in the wall. In the back far corner of the room, a massive crater drops into a deep black hole, too deep to see the bottom with torches. Unwilling to take any further risks, and needing to heal Kaz's frostbite, the team goes to sleep in the cave.
