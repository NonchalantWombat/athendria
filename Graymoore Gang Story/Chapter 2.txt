# Chapter 2 - Leafside

### 6th of Ahwa:

* After buying coffee drinks, the group followed Zephyr to the Sparklight Chantry to seek curse removal. Within, they found multiple shrines to the different deities.
* A caretaker named Friar Luke informed them that Friar Whambeg, the senior cleric, was out visiting the apiary outside town and had yet to return.
* Zephyr spent some time reading, while the others suggested they visit the isle in the center of the lake, where they had all heard the clattering coming from the night before.
* The dwarven girl they had rescued from the ogres gifted them a pendant of dwarvenkind, and thanked them again as her family moved on from Leafside.
* On the way to the docks, a suspicious halfling bumped into Zephyr. She immediately checked, and he had stolen her scrolls. A chase ensued, and the halfling jumped into an enchanted canoe and flew off towards the center of the lake.
* Ser magically created long canoe for the team, while Dhamiria rowed and Kaz flew, towing the boat along to give chase.
* The halfing's magic rowboat beat them to the island, and he dissappeared into the ruins as they approached. Exploring the ruins, the team fought off several rust monsters and an ankheg that were in cages rigged to open when they entered the room.
* Kaz's sword was destroyed by the rust monsters, and almost died in the process. Ser healed him back. The group then explored the remainder of the ruins for loot.
* They found a statue in a dried out fountain in the center of the keep ruins with a riddle that seemed unsolvable. 
* At the back end of the ruins, they found a chapel that had crumbled into the lake. It was suspicious, and after a thorough inspection, they found that the rocks falling down the hole made the exact same clattering noise everyone kept hearing at night.
* Ser tried to convince anyone who could be listening that they were friends. While this didn't do anything, Ser did notice a flicker of movement out of the corner of his eye.
* Following this, the team discovered an illusory wall leading to a network of carved tunnels beneath the ruins. Evidence of excavation and broken rock explained the noises, as rocks would be dumped into the lake and clatter down the cliffside. 
* Chained owlbears attacked the group as they explored deeper. Ser managed to scare them away with illusions, and kept them at bay that way.
* They disarmed multiple traps along the way, and noticed the numerous chests filled with decorative geodes and rocks. At the back of the cave systems, they found a room with some furniture.
* Kaz noticed that the table was illusory, and the fugitive burst out from hiding behind it. Dhamiria quickly restrained him, and reveals the man to be **Vorros**, the gnomish rogue wanted by the CCC, after removing his hat of illusion.
* Vorros explains that the CCC wants him because of his exorbitant gambling debts. He claims to have read a manuscript in Drakkengrad about a treasure located here on this isle, so he is excavating and steal to try and raise enough money to pay off his debts.
* Wanting to also find the treasure, the team gets to work digging as well. Eventually, through magic and might, they unearth what appears to be a massive geode, buried deep in the rock beneath the ruins. It had an intense abjuration aura, and is unidentifiable otherwise. Deciding to turn in the gnome and let it be, the team returned to Leafside.
* Instead of handing the fugitive over the Order of the Grasping Fist, who requested him, the team takes him straight to the CCC to collect on the bounty. They successfully evade the inspections of Soliana and Otis, who suspect them, with illusion magic and convincing lies.
* After some shopping, they head to bed at the tavern. Zephyr is accosted once again by the magical demon in the bag, despite sleeping in a different room. She barely wakes up in time, despite feeling its cold breath on her neck.

## **LEVEL UP (5)**

### 7th of Ahwa:

* The next morning the team beelined for the Chantry to seek aid for Zephyr. They learned that Friar Whambeg was still missing, and may have fallen astray of some trouble. 
* The group decides to ride out to the Apiary Fields and seek him. They gathered their mounts and went west. Along the route, the encountered horrible wooden displays along the road, draped in viscera and bowels. They quickly rode past.
* At the fields, they found that hundreds of bees had been turned to stone, falling into the flowers below. The trail of stone bees led the group to a nearby cave, where they witnessed a basilisk chewing on a stone leg.
* They ambushed it, crushing it before anyone was subjected to its gaze, submerging it in magical darkness. In the cave, they found a statue of Friar Whambeg, too late to save him from being petrified.
* They gathered him into a cart and returned to Leafside. They noticed the guts on display had been removed, with no apparent reason.
* The team dropped off the statue of Friar Whambeg at the Chantry, as well as the basilisk corpse. Friar Luke stated he would get to work on distilling a remedy from the corpse with the help of the local alchemist.
* That night, Zephyr didn't sleep. She was too paranoid to rest, afraid of what might come out of the bag.

### 8th of Ahwa:

* Everyone bought fancy coffee drinks, and Ser purchased several healing kits. Kaz bought a new sword to replace his broken one.
* Dhamiria made friends with an elven smith named **Elvara Krismus**. She was very curious about Dhamiria's glaive, and the smithing techniques used to forge it. Ser sold Elvara the geodes that the team had collected, and she sharpened Dhamiria's glaive for her.
* They visited the tavern to buy some booze for Zehruut, and then sought out Tormod McLeary in the town square. Ser summoned a magical vat of moonshine for him, and he gladly told the group everything he knew.
* They learned from Tormod that the Re-Emboweler is an evil goblin raider. They also learned about the **Ox** is a powerful man, seeking to conquer the continent, and that he has a representative hiding in town, who showed Tormod a vision of the Ox.
* The group headed out of town to seek the Re-Emboweler. They eventually found some goblins and defeated them, following their trail into the deeper woods to a goblin encampment.
* The Re-Emboweler made himself known, and it became obvious that he was a Nilbog, a cursed and powerful chaotic magic goblin.
* After a difficult fight, during which the spirit of the Nilbog jumped from goblin to goblin, avoiding death, the team managed to kill it by destroying the blood-red cap that it wore. Zehruut and Mittens were put to good use, killing goblins left and right and helping the team.
* One goblin survived, and was released into the woods, no longer under the control of the Nilbog. In the cave nearby, a horrific pile of entrails covered gold and loot.
* They picked up a few potions and a pendant of the drunkard.
* They returned to Leafide and slept in the tavern. Zephyr slept in the Chantry, hoping for protection, but the creature attacked her in her sleep once again. Dhamiria detected something was wrong, and helped to wake Zephyr. Dhamiria saw the Bagman once she touched Zephyr's arm, and no longer doubted her bad dreams.

### 9th of Ahwa:

* That morning the group talked about the issue of the Bagman, and decided to wait for Friar Whambeg to be revived. They headed to the Drakkeep to speak with Rolar and collect their rewards for the Re-Emboweler and the Clattering Keep.
* Rolar was impressed with their work and re-assessed their value. She paid them, but was still unwilling to share any information about the Ox. She did tell them that he was a warlord that may be linked to the decimation of the city of **Laudron**.
* The team visited the coffee shop, caffeinating for the day. After some unproductive reading in the library about Bladewitches and nightmare monsters, they sought out Darkbrow, the dwarven trade baron.
* He offered the group a job as guards for a shipment to Arkalon, the neighboring city to the east. The caravan was scheduled to leave on the 12th. The Drakelord of Arkalon, **Drakelord Shasa**, would pay them when they arrived.
* Darkbrow also revealed that all the hollows seem to be former denizens of Laudron and Seaside, two cities that have recently gone dark.
* Ser and Dhamiria bride a guard to grant them access to see baby blue drakes, which are very, very cute.
* That night, the group returned to the Chantry to witness Friar Whambeg's ressurection. As the stone begins to crumble away, Zephyr feels a cold wash over her and sees the following vision...

*You are standing in a snowy field surrounded by trees. Before you, a beautiful structure carved from sculpted stone lies ahead. The architecture is foreign, but expertly crafted, almost organic in the lines of the walls and the slope of the roof. It consists of a central structure with a taller tower attached beyond it. As the snow falls gently down around you, you hear a crunching noise. You turn, and see a humanoid figure approaching, with a furred, elongated hood around the face. As you look beneath the hood, you see a cold-looking woman, with dark green skin and tremendously long ears. She looks through you, past you, not even seeing you. She gazes up towards the tower, and the expression on her face is one of concern. You see faintly glowing lines in intricate patterns across her face, too delicate and detailed to decipher their significance. She walks towards the entrance to the building, running her hand along a wooden fence surrounding a barren patch of exposed earth untouched by the falling snow…*

*You follow the woman into the structure. Inside it is warm and filled with more expertly crafted furniture in the same style as the building. Many of the devices sitting on tables are alien to you, their purpose and function unknowable. You wish to look closer, but the woman hurries along, dropping the cloak on the table and stepping into a small cylindrical room at the end of the hall. You are drawn along with her, helpless, and watch as the lower room falls away from sight as the small room lifts upwards within the tower. It slows smoothly to a stop at the top, and the woman steps out into a circular room, where another humanoid turns to face her. This one seems to be a man of the same race, but with a more blueish tint to his skin. The two embrace and share words in a language you cannot understand. The woman seems upset, while the man attempts to console her. Your eyes are drawn away from the two, and they seem magnetically drawn to a glass bell jar on the countertop, surrounded by arcane instruments and tubes. Within, a swirling dark mass of cloud and shadow gently circulates. As you gaze at it, two points of light flicker into being within the fog and stare back…*

*You are now looking from within the glass jar, outwards into the tower room. You feel calm and comfortable, and you wait patiently for your creator to return. A day later, your awareness is roused by raised voices. The creator and his partner burst into the room from the elevator, shouting at each other in raised voices. You feel confusion. The creator rushes around the room, grabbing items and talking hurriedly to the partner. He drags a box out into the middle of the room and begins to toss things into it. The room is filled with a sudden flare of orange light, pouring in from the window. Through the thick glass, you can barely see a swirling, twisting pattern to the light, and both the people in the room shout out as the floor shudders. The creator spins to you, grabbing your jar from the table it rests on. His voice rings out in your mind, telepathically clear for an instant:*

*“I’m moving you somewhere safe for now. Wait for me; I’ll let you out soon, but for now you must be alone. I’m sorry, little one.”*

*You send back a sense of understanding and comfort, wishing for the creator to be reassured, for you can sense the intense fear and tumultuous emotions within his mind. These intense emotions are the last thing you sense as the jar is opened, and you are poured into a dark, empty and cold void.*

*You wait.*

*You wait.*

*You wait.*

*An eternity of solitude.*

*Waiting.*

*Festering.*

*You crave your jar.*

*You crave the warmth.*

*You crave the likeness of the creator.*

*You wait ..........*

* The vision ends.

*While Zephyr experienced this vision of another time and another place, she was possessed by the **Bagman**. Smoke swirled off her body, and the team had to attack to keep her at bay. Evnetually, Ser managed to knock the bagman from Zephyr, and they managed to trap it inside a barrel with Dhamiria. After a tense few moments, as Friar Whambeg stumbles out of his stone prison and lent aid to the battle, the Bagman was banished as Zephyr choked it with a Chill Touch spell.
* Zephyr noticed that the house in her vision reminded her of Mosstop Ruins on the road from Graymoore.

### 10th of Ahwa:

* Finally freed from the curse, Zephyr and the group slept at the Chantry overnight. The next morning, the group discussing alerting Rolar to the presence of the dwarven spy that McLeary had told them about.
* Kaz and Dhamiria had an arm wrestling match testing out his new Gauntlets of Ogre Strength he had found while on the island.
* Ser went to the garrison to train with a shield and medium armor, seeking instruction in how to wield them. It was mostly unproductive, and Ser realized he would need to train for many days to get competent with them.
* Zephyr took the day to relax and recover, flying her kite over the docks on the lake. Dhamiria joined and watched her, after spending a few hours training Mittens further.

### 11th of Ahwa:

* The following day, the group Rolar to relay the info on the red haired dwarf that they discovered.
* The team went shopping for a bit, and noticed a couple of guards following a hooded dwarf in the square.
* As they watched, the clocktower struck noon. The dwarf pulled back his hood, turned outwards towards the town, and a pulse of psionic energy blasted outwards from him.
* Everyone in the square, including the team, collapsed. Zephyr was the only one who resisted, albeit with a searing pain in her head.
* Fortunately, the dwarf appeared to be preoccupied with his powerful exertion, so Zephyr ran to him and slashed him to ribbons with wind magic.
* However, in that short period, everyone who had collapsed was receiving a foreboding message in their heads, as a massive presence unfolded around them, speaking directly into their minds, using the dwarf as a conduit...

### ***"PEOPLE OF THE MIDLANDS!"***

(A booming voice resounds through you minds. An immense presence swells within your minds eye, taking the form of a set of glowing blue eyes, with horns curling around an indistinct face.)

*"I come to you now, speaking through my humble servant, to bring you tidings of the dawning of a new age."*

*"I welcome you to this new era. You have undoubtably seen the sad remnants of humanity stumbling through the woods and hills, preying upon anything in their way. They are what is worst about all peoples: savagery, hunger, selfishness, being driven solely by instinct and greed. They are all that's left in a person once their humanity is gone."*

*"I claim full responsibility for these husks, these hollow beings. They were vetted by the same trial that I will bring to all peoples, a trial that found them lacking. My servant you see before you is one of the chosen few who has passed through the fire, and now stands on the other side, ready to lead all the worthy into tomorrow..."*

(You see rapid-fire images of many determined people, standing proud and firm: this red-headed dwarf, an young drow woman with vittiligo, a human man and women with brown hair wearing rags, holding each others hand and spears in their hands, and others).

*"My message is this: **Rejoice**! I bring all the worthy peoples of the Midlands a new beginning, an opportunity to bring forth strength in those able to wield it. I also bring a necessary evil, a culling of the weak and those distained by fate, so that the chosen few may repopulate the world and bring it into a new era of peace and connection that the world has never even considered possible."*

*"I am **the Ox**. I was deemed worthy by fate to weild a skill greater than any the world has yet seen. I am the unceasing strength that will pull all peoples out of the mud of our primitive prior existence and drag all of us into a new future where we may all rejoice in unity, without false gods, without division and political lines. Harness yourselves to the yoke of progress, and together we will transform the world."*

*"Seek me, and I will bring you truth. Abandon your leaders, for all they can give you is more of the same failings. We will drag humanity into the future regardless of what they believe, and all the worthy are welcome in this utopia."*

(The Ox's attention shifts to the red-haired dwarf, and others similarly standing in courtyards and taverns elsewhere.)

*"Thank you, my dear servants. You are equals in my sight, and your sacrifices will never be forgotten. We all thank you."*

(A multitude of voices and emotions, an overwelling of gratitude and appreciation).

*"Now, to those who are still listening: the unworthy crave what the worthy have. Guard yourselves, for the unworthy will come, seeking a taste of the power that I wield through my servant now. If you survive the trials ahead, you last trail awaits you in my Prescence. Seek me at Hillfar,  and I will give all the strong and the brave their best chance to surpass the trial that awaits you all."*

* As the message ended, and Zephyr struck down the dwarf channeling the Ox's message, the team and the rest of Leafside staggered back to their feet.
* Dazed and confused, they all spoke together and ruminated on what they had just heard. At that moment, warning bells rang out, signaling an attack on Leafside.
* They ran to the outer walls, and witnessed dozens, hundreds, of Hollows running out from the surrounding forests and charging towards Leafside. They began to pile up against the walls, shaking them and threating to break through.
* Kaz flew over the swarm, raining down Eldritch Blasts, while Zephyr and Ser used Thunderwave to knock them back. Dhamiria sprinted off to grab Mittens from the stables, and she met up with Rolar and several other Drakkenguard ready to charge out through the front gate and meet the Hollows head on.
* In the chaos that ensued, Dhamiria and Mittens slashed down many Hollows alongside the people of Leafside and Rolar astride her giant, lightning-breathing Blue Drake.
* Hollows broke through the wall, and Zephyr and held the line with Clouds of Daggers and thunderwaves to push them back.
* The battle only lasted a few minutes, but in that time the team was responsible for slaying 128 Hollows. After the majority of them were dealt with, Ser ran outside and began to heal the wounded soldiers, saving over 22 of them.
* The group waited for awhile, but eventually returned to sleep, utterly drained mentally and physically from the Battle of Leafside. From this day, the team became known locally as the Legends of Leafside, for their heroism and might in defending the walls from the Hollow threat.

### 12th of Ahwa through the 17th of Ahwa:

* In the week that follows, Darkbrow felt obliged to reward the group a reward for their valiant defense in the form of rare inks and paper, as well as coin. Rolar also thanked the group, granting them a badge with tanned blue drake hide upon it, a symbol of her approval and gratitude.
* The team packed up and left Leafside,  joining the caravan to Arkalon, and acting as its guards along the road into the Stygian Swamp.
* A few blue drake riders accompanied them as guards.
* On the second day, the group encountered a wandering salesman, a hobgoblin named Walt. The group pooled their resources to buy a magic drum for Ser.
* On the fourth day, a giant crocodile attacked from the standing pools of water, eating Kaz's horse, Shrew. It dragged the poor creature into the swamp, and the caravan ran away, leaving Kaz to walk on foot.
* On the fifth day, a zealous cleric of Pelor was found to have gathered a small group of people along the road to witness the public burning of Hollows they had captured. He yelled about the end times, and sought to cleanse Athendria of the "sullied creatures."
* The group noticed one of the Hollows, may in fact just be a scared and mute young girl. They intervened, using magic to scare off the cleric's gang, and saved the young hobgoblin girl from a terrible fate.
* On the sixth day, Hollows and Giant Toads attacked the caravan. One of the Hollows climbed into the cart, pulling out a necklace of fireballs and chewing through it, immolating the middle cart. Mittens was swallowed whole by a giant toad, but Dhamiria and Zephyr saved him. Overall, it was a tough and dangerous battle, but they saved most of the caravan.
