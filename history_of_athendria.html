<h2>The First Age:</h2>
<h5>??? - 500 BD: Primordials Shape Athendria</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Alien races and powerful beings from across the multiverse wander through time and space. One of these entities, known only as the <strong>Primogenitor</strong>, arrived on Athendria, a mostly barren and empty rock in an insignificant corner of the Universe. Their immense powers alters it forever.</li>
    <li>
        <p>Plants and animals populate the planet, but some of those species are favored by the omnipotent entity, granting them sentience.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Aboleths arise within the deep oceans</li>
            <li>The Giants are born upon the land and the mountains</li>
            <li>The Dragons take flight in the skies</li>
            <li>Small and insignificant mortal humanoid races, unrecognizable to the races we now know, are born from the lesser impulses of the <strong>Primogenitor</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Eventually, for unknown reasons, the <strong>Primogenitor</strong> abandoned Athendria, wandering to other Planes of Existence.</li>
</ul>

<h5>~ 400 BD: Clash of the Ancients</h5>
<ul>
    <li>In the absence of their creator, the Aboleths, Dragons, and Giants fight for supremacy.</li>
    <li>The weak minor races barely survive, hiding from the massive creatures wreaking havoc on the realm.</li>
    <li>It is a stalemate between these powerful forces, and the strongest among them begin to rise.</li>
    <li>Athendria is a chaotic realm, consisting of a single megacontinent and an endless ocean.</li>
</ul>

<h5>~ 200 BD: Rise of the Gods</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>The Blood Queen, Bahamut, and Annam arose as leaders of the ancient titan races, representing the Sea, Air, and the Land.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>They received worship by the minor races, further enhancing their power through the immensity of faith and arcane potential of their collective consciousness.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Meanwhile, the minor races begin to grow in power, tapping into potent residual magics left behind by the <strong>Primogenitor</strong>. That, in addition to alliances with the Dragons, grows some of the mortals' power to god-like levels.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The fighting reaches a tipping point, with a catastrophic battle wiping out most of all three races occurs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A powerful mage known as Aegir channels the primordial power of the oceans and lead the minor aquatic races in an uprising against their enslavement by the Aboleths.</li>
            <li>The Aboleths are banished to the neighboring planet Yoria, along with their grotesque Blood Queen. The losses in accomplishing this feat were so immense, that Aegir and their followers fled Athendria forever, to the Plane of Water to seek refuge.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>With the Dragons distracted by the chaos in the sea, Five Metallic Dragons fused their collective power to rival the power of their leader Bahamut. This entity was known as Tiamat, and it led an uprising against Bahamut that destroyed most of Dragonkind. Bahamut won, banishing Tiamat to the depths of the hellish plane Avernus, but at great cost. She suffered a grevious wound, and fled Athendria to form the plane of Mount Celestia to survive.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Gemstone Dragons were placed into stasis and preserved in impenetrable Geodes that sunk into the earth, banished from the skies for their neutrality by Bahamut and his coordination with the ancient Bard, Rhu'Darok and many other mages.</li>
            <li>Any remaining dragons scattered and went into hiding, avoiding direction contact with each other and with the mortals covering the planet.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The giants witnessed the death of their leader Annam, who fell into a massive chasm. His fall was so tremendous, it shook the whole planet with a rending earthquake. The megacontinent split into three, separating and forming the three continents of Kamuin, Ebrea, and Ikesh.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The giants squabbled over who was to lead, and eventually settled on the Ordning, a rigid hierarchy of power. Heavily damaged by the in-fighting, the Giants similarly fled to reclusive regions of the world.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>In the century that followed, the minor races rapidly filled the world, growing in power, and accessing the primal energies of the land sea and sky. The dominant race that emerged is now only known as the <em>Ascendants</em>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Several mortals from this civilization ascended to true godhood through their arcane knowledge and mastery of the <strong>Primogenitor's</strong> magic.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Inevitably, their followers aligned to the ones that represented them best, and assigned them role and aspects.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>80 BD: The Planar Wars</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Many greater and lesser deities, worshiped by legions of zealots, engaged in a war that raged across the whole realm of Athendria, as well as the planes beyond, many of which were formed in the process. Millions died in the chaos, and the energies being channeled in this conflict drew the attention of other god-like entities from across the planes.</li>
    <li>Athendria became the focal point of multi-dimensional conflict between the gods and other god-like entities, fighting for access to its rich resources, potent magics, and fervent followers. The conflict burned, fueled by politcal divisions, philosophical differences, and pure survival.</li>
    <li>As the gods begin to realize Athendria lacked space to hold them all, some began to isolate themselves on different planes and take advantage of the resources there.</li>
    <li>This diaspora leads into the current status quo, where the pantheon of known and unknown deities and their followers exist scattered across the planes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Denouement and the Century of Ash:</h2>
<h5>Year 0: The Cataclysm</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The fighting reaches a head, with the Blood War from the Hells bleeding over into Athendria. The good-aligned deities still present in Athendria take a stand against clashing of the demons and devils, and combined their powers for a single act of magic that banished all deific power from Athendria, and sealed away the forces of evil back into their respective planes.</li>
    <li>This magical act is known as the <strong>Great Expulsion</strong>, and it was the last great act of the gods on Athendria to protect their followers from the dangers of divine power left unchecked.</li>
    <li>The consequences of this magical violence was so catastrophic, it devastated all civilizations, undid most technologies, and robbed many mortals of their powers. It transformed many of the existing races into further, complex races, of the varieties seen today across Athendria. Untold multitude of lives were lost in the Planar Wars, and the minor races were mostly set back to simple tools, innate magic, and rudimentary technology after the Catacylsm.</li>
</ul>
<h5>100 PC: Rebuilding from the Ashes</h5>
<ul>
    <li>In the fallout from the Cataclysm, the minor races diversified, covered the continents, and began to rebuild. They began to rediscover magic and technology, but were mostly focused on survival. The climate was chaotic, and took almost a century to stabilize.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Second Age; the Age of Growth:</h2>
<h5>260 PC: Rise of the Velki Enclave</h5>
<ul>
    <li>On the continent of Kamuin, groups formed around culture and stability. A group of talented magic-users discovered the <em>Lapis Arcanum</em>, a crystallized remanant of the Primogenitor. Their study of its bottomless power led to a rapid expansion in technology and magical technique. They rallied around it, and their use of its power formed the <em>Velki Enclave</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h5>325 PC: The Peak of Velkian Power</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The Velkian Enclave grew to encompass much of Kamuin and beyond, rediscovering older magic and exploring new schools of magic. Civilization flourished, and new developments happened rapidly.</li>
</ul>
<h5>354 PC: Nangshi Monastery Constructed in the Astral Sea</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Velkian mages and clerics founded a mystical Monastery deep in the Astral Sea, bridging religious differences to ensure the survival of good forces in Athendria and beyond.</li>
</ul>
<h5>370 PC: The Founding of the Plutocracy of Uthor</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The elves founded Uthorim on the eastern shores of Kamuin, and have been relatively reclusive in the centuries since.</li>
</ul>
<h5>420 PC: The Founding of the Kingdom of Groz</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The dwarven empire arose in the south of Kamuin, as reclusive but wealthy dwarves engaged in trade with the elves and other tribes of the continent.</li>
    <li>Grozmirlun was founded after several centuries of inter-clan conflict in the hills and caves at the end of the Worldspine Mountains. The victorious dwarves took over the surface, and the bitter deep dwarves descended into the underdark.</li>
</ul>
<h5>432 PC: The Fall of the Velki Enclave</h5>
<ul>
    <li>An ancient red dragon known as <em><strong>Hemdorak the Merciless</strong></em> emerged from hiding and attacked the heart of the Velkian Enclave, seeking the fabled <em>Lapis Arcanum</em>. He utterly destroyed their capital city, stole the stone, and killed the vast majority of the citizens and mages remaining.</li>
    <li>A young and talented mage, known as Birru, returned from an expedition to find his city and people in ruins. Vowing revenge, he sought out Hemdorak in the years that followed. He eventually stole the stone back, and barely managed to banish Hemdorak to the Plane of Fire with its power.</li>
    <li>Determined to protect this world from the harm of such monstrous creatures ever again, he traveled the continent and beyond, seeking out and sealing shut all existing natural portals that he could find connecting Athendria to the other planes. The binding magic that held the portals shut was maintained by the seemingly infinite depths of the Lapis Arcanum's power.</li>
    <li>Despite Birru's efforts, the Velki Enclave was ruined, and its infrastructure collapsed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Third Age; the Age of Isolation:</h2>
<h5>503 PC: The Founding of the city of Lutetia</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Birru gathered together like-minded industrious denizens of the mid-continent, choosing to create a new city and new civilization where all could flourish, free from the threat of other planes, dangerous magic, and more.</li>
    <li>Birru led the city as a King, facilitating trade and nurturing the smaller surrounding towns that were rising up.</li>
</ul>
<h5>509 PC: The Founding of the Reznor Dominion on Ikesh</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Dark elves, deep dwarves, deep gnomes and other subterranean races rose to the surface from centuries in isolation in the Underdark, and found a home on the cold and dark continent of Ikesh.</li>
    <li>Only the dark elves remained organized, and they established the first city Kellenora, at the base of the Darkspire Mountains on Ikesh.</li>
    <li>In the centuries that followed, the Dark Elves expanded and formed the Reznor Dominon, a matriarchal, racial society.</li>
</ul>
<h5>543 PC: The Creation of the Dragonborn Homeland, Thaumdural</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The proud dragonborn found a natural home on the peak of Mount Strohlcairn on Kamuin, in the natural springs fueled by the simmering volcanic activity. They began to develop culture and focus on trading unique minerals and flying mounts they had tamed on the mountaintops.</li>
</ul>
<h5>589 PC: The Founding of Gnomeopolis</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Gnomes gathered in the Crast Hills of Kamuin, on the shores of Attawich Loch. Initially a fishing town, the city grew rapidly after mining adventures discovered a wealth of ore beneath the hills.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>702 PC:</strong> The miners discovered Welbi Shards, reddish crystals containing potent energy</li>
            <li><strong>833 PC:</strong> Upstart hobgoblins from the north instigated the Hobgoblin Conquests, an ongoing conflict between the denizens of the Crast Hills and the northern goblinoids</li>
            <li><strong>834 PC:</strong> In response to the threat, the gnomish inventor Welbi created the <strong>Warforged</strong>: robotic humanoids designed to defend his people against the hordes from the north. This development was highly effective, and the hobgoblins were scattered.</li>
            <li><strong>865 PC:</strong> A warforged unit named itself as Uryon, and led the other warforged in the Ury Uprising against their gnomish masters. Peace was quickly sought, and the gnomes banned the techniques of Warforged production. The Warforged fled in ships to Ikesh, and established  <em><strong>New Uryopolis </strong></em> on the subcontinent island of Autria.
            <li><strong>892 PC:</strong> The gnomes reclaimed the hideous sport of Gnomeball, originally invented by the hobgoblin hordes to play a game using gnome heads, and made it their own using a leather ball and performance-enhancing tech.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>735 PC: The Founding of Brightshore</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Desiring to claim a strong position on the coast of Kamuin, Birru facilitated the creation of the city of Brightshore on the river delta at the mouth of the Frostfall River as it meets the Vanjan Sea.</li>
    <li>Birru instigated local prominent nobility to govern it independently, as part of the land-sea trade route.</li>
</ul>
<h5>762 PC: Establishment of Crystallia</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Several wealthy trade families from across Ikesh and Kamuin gathered and formed the trade city of Crystallia in the neutral location of the Crystal Sands Desert on Ebrea.</li>
    <li>It rapidly grew with the influx of cash and strategic location on the shores of Ebrea.</li>
</ul>
<h5>797 PC: Establishment of Drakkengrad in the Midlands</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Five barbarian tribes in the Midlands of Ikesh impressed several of the wild dragons living there with their tenacity.</li>
    <li>They were gifted with Drakes, loyal, magic-derived creatures that represent the five colors of chromatic dragon.</li>
    <li>With the drakes as their focus, the tribes shared their power and rose as the <em>Drakelords of Ikesh</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Drakkengrad</strong> formed in the center of the five tribes, and rapidly grew as the Drakelords forged alliances and established their boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<h5>854 PC: The Creation of the Birrundul Empire</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Birru combined the scattered cities and warring tribes of the region into a single unified empire.</li>
    <li>He took on a new alias of Emperor Fevagore, and hid his appearance to hide his unnatural longevity, thanks to the <em>Lapis Arcanum</em>.</li>
    <li>Birru continued to hide the Lapis from any who would seek to abuse its power.</li>
</ul>
<h5>882 PC: Creation of Awyn's Tablets</h5>
<ul>
    <li>A lycanthrope druid known as Aywn forged two tablets, one for each of the two moons of Athendria. These tablets contained the power to request a wish of the dual moon dieties, Selune and Malar.</li>
    <li>A mage known as Horrister the Wise learned of Awyn's creation, and feared it potential. He defeated Aywn, and took one tablet to destroy it. Awyn banished the other tablet with her dying breath, and perished. Horrister broke the tablet, threw one piece into Attiwich Loch, and left the other piece with a young elven priestess of Selune, <em>Sumia Silvertail</em> for safekeeping without mentioning why.</li>
    <li>Horrister wrote his story down, postulating the other tablets may have been banished to the Feywild and/or Shadowfell.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Fourth Age; the Age of Rectification:</h2>

<h5>902 PC: The Founding of Thrigrun, by the Brotherhood of Heiroenous</h5>
<h5>982 PC: The Founding of Urk, the First Orc City</h5>
<h5>993 PC: The Invention of Airship Technology</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Crystallian technologists traded with the Birdfolk of the Isle Gravitaas, and established airships. They use them extensively on Ebrea and Ikesh, and have introduced the technology to other major cities for intercontinental trade. Kamuin has been excluded in this initial trade agreement, due to tensions between the Reznor and Uthorim.</li>
</ul>
<h5>1035 - 1072 PC: The Flash Wars</h5>
<ul>
    <li>A conflict between the Uryon Confederation and the Reznor Dominion escalated as the result of racial tensions in trade cities between the two, and of expansionist tendencies by the Shadequeen of the Reznor.</li>
    <li>The fighting endured for 37 years before a fragile cease-fire was declared</li>
    <li>Tensions remain high to this day, and the conflict has had flare-ups in the years since, as the Reznor continue to seek an opening in the impenetrable defenses of the Uryon Confederation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1075: The Chronicles of the Capable Crew</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Four budding heroes began to adventure in Kamuin, starting in the misty town of Frostford...
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Janos</strong>, a middle-aged half-elf monk charlatan from the prisons of Lutetia</li>
            <li><strong>Spinel</strong>, an earth-touched rural druidess from Lubdin</li>
            <li><strong>Notrick</strong>, an orc barbarian blacksmith hoping to earn fame and fortune</li>
            <li><strong>Nameless</strong>, a masked, orange-eyed angelborn shadow sorceror, without a name or a past</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, the <em>Lapis Arcanum,</em> the fabled endless font of magical energy, has finally run empty. Its power was fueling the numerous portal closures around the world, as well as the centuries long life of Birru. As its power rapidly waned, the enchantments woven by Birru long ago began to weaken.</li>
    <li>The seal on the portal to the plane of fire failed, and <strong>Hemdorak</strong> returned. His appearance resulted in the rapid destruction of Thaumdural, an event that was desired by assassins hired by an unknown source from Brightshore.</li>
    <li>Planar portals across the continent and beyond began to open once again.</li>
    <li>The heroes inadvertantly woke three ancient mages, frozen in time from the era of the Velki Enclave. They are known only as the <strong>Velkian Dissidents</strong>.</li>
    <li>The Nightwalker Guild was destroyed in Lutetia by our heroes, who branded themselves as the Capable Crew.</li>
    <li>Birru reached out to the Capable Crew, informed them of his failures, and asked them to defend the realm from the monsters beyond the opening portals.</li>
    <li>The team defeated several planar Monstrosities (a Kraken, a Phoenix, and an Ooze)</li>
    <li>They traveled to the Plane of Water, to the Isle of Dread, to retrieve the fabled weapon Dragonsbane.</li>
    <li>With the mythic weapon, they defeated <strong>Hemdorak</strong> and <strong>Syvleth</strong>, two draconic horrors linked to the Velki Enclave.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>1076 PC:</h5>
    <ul>
    <li>Emperor Birru finally passed away, as the last drops of power left the Lapis. He gifted the now inert stone to Nameless.</li>
    <li>The machinations of the Velkian Dissidents were revealed: their goal was to create a new Lapis Arcanum, forged from the stolen souls of thousands.</li>
    <li>With this artificial creation, they sought to ascend to godhood.</li>
    <li>The Dissidents turned several cities to stone, harnessing their souls to grow a new crystal.</li>
    <li>During their final effort, as they sought to harvest the souls from Lutetia and channel the energies of the positive and negative planes of energy, the Capable Crew took a stand against them with their allies and friends on the Balmere Plateau.</li>
    <li>The Capable Crew stopped the evildoers, and restored the cities of Crystallia and Lutetia using their considerable powers.</li>
    <li>They became legends, and the empire entered into a period of peace.</li>
    <li>Janos oversaw the creation of the <strong>Order of the Grasping Fist</strong>, negotiating trade agreements with Crystallia.</li>
    <li>Spinel wanders the planes seeking to restore balance where necessary banishing undeath in the name of her goddess Melora.</li>
    <li>Notrick established the <strong>League of Blue Steel</strong>, a monster hunter and smithing guild.</li>
    <li>Nameless, now going by Abdiel, wanders the planes collecting rare and magical items, and collaborating with powerful entities.</li>
    <li>Athendria enters a couple decades of relative peace and prosperity.</li>
</ul>
<h5>1082 PC: Creation of Firearms in the Ebrean city of Xuanya</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Cultured hobgoblins and gnomish civilization clash curiously, resulting in unique architecture and technology</li>
    <li>Rifles and hand pistols are developed, along with hand grenades and similar weaponry.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1093: The Annals of the Heroes of Harmstead</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A party of adventurers meet in Brooksburg, in the northern reaches of the Skuldur region on Kamuin. Their adventure begins…
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Galaxea</strong>, a water-touched half-elf cleric from Uthorim</li>
            <li><strong>Porkchop</strong>, a shifter rogue from the city streets of Lutetia</li>
            <li><strong>Thuzzal</strong>, a changling archer living alone, seeking to escape his past</li>
            <li><strong>Chad Broheart</strong>, a half-orc paladin of Hieroneous, spreading the good word of brotherhood</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>After exploring the caves beneath the town, a pit fiend <strong>Goht Dumag</strong> is summoned to defeat the demon Bezilak at the request of the team. He stopped the demon, but then flies away into the night.</li>
    <li>On the road south, a mage known as <strong>Old Thrush</strong>, a holdover from the Nightwalker Guild, is defeated and his gang is destroyed by the group.</li>
    <li>In the depths of Attawich Loch near Gnomeopolis, Galaxea discovers an ancient temple to one of the titans, Aegir, and defeats the beholder named <strong>Borglyn the Boytrose</strong>, uncovering half of <strong>Awyn's Tablet</strong> in the process.</li>
    <li>The team face of against <strong>Gellureth</strong>, an adult White Dragon, on the shore of the Loch, defeating after fighting in an ice cave. Their heroic efforts freed Harmstead from the Dragon's influence, earning them their name.</li>
</ul>
<h5>1094 PC:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>After traveling to Lutetia, Chad uncovers an artifact known as the <strong>Third Fist of Hextor</strong> deep in the catacombs.</li>
    <li>The team travels to Crooked Rock, after taking an airship from the Tower of the Grasping Fist, seeking insight about the Tablet shard Porkchop had found.</li>
    <li>Porkchop collects the Tables of Awyn, and with a wish, binds the two gods of the moons, Malar and Selune, into a hybrid deity for all lycanthropes, Selunar.</li>
    <li>The team travels to Nanghsi Monastery in the Astral Sea, and Chad seals the Fist of Hextor inside their mystical archives</li>
    <li>Afterwards, the team discovers a plot by Goht Dumag, controlling Frost Giants, to take over Uthorim.</li>
    <li>The team repels the giant invasion and defeats the devil, earning the title of Gateholders</li>
    <li>They seal a portal to Stygia deep within Rimehold in the far north, and destroy Goht Dumag at the source</li>
    <li>Traveling to Shelthalas, the team destroyed two Reznor Ambassadors who were using the power of another Fist of Hextor to start conflict</li>
    <li>They are aided by the Firstborn, who flee afterwards and reform as a monster hunting guild in the years after</li>
    <li>They adopt a strange sentient fleshy mass known as Little Bro and teach it many things</li>
